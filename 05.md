# Chapter 5

Sometime in the 1970s, someone had put an addition on the back of the Jackson Building and renovated the basement. The basement and the addition both had suspended ceilings, and the floors were all covered with white, vinyl tile like they have in grocery stores. In the basement, the suspended ceiling was unusually low, in contrast to Hank's extra-high ceiling upstairs.

A day or two after my first meeting with Hank, they gave me a sad little office in the basement. It had a small window that was partly above the suspended ceiling, so a previous resident had removed one of the ceiling tiles to let more light in. To get there, I entered the building through a glass door in the addition and went down an echoey set of white-tiled stairs. I pretty much stopped using the front door, and I started thinking of the glass door as the servants' entrance.

I shared the office with Hank's only other grad student, a Kuwaiti Ph.D. student named Adwait. He had another office in the petroleum building, so I rarely saw him. I think he only used our office when he got tired of his office mates. I was frequently the only person in the whole basement, where most of the rooms were full of file cabinets and obsolete office equipment. I brought in a boombox and started listening to loud music while I worked.

All the other economic geology students had their offices in the geoscience building, which was called Wallace Hall, and I spent a lot of time over there. Tom hadn't been kidding when he talked about collaborating with our colleagues, and in the first week of classes we were huddling late into the night to help each other decipher our notes and homework assignments. As a bonus, some of the students who had been around longer would help us out, because they happened to be in the same office. It was nice to have an instant peer group, even if it was grueling.

During the second week of school, Tom stopped me in the hall to tell me that someone named Zeke Gray wanted to be on my committee. I had never heard of him. Tom said, "I gave him your email address, and he'll get in touch with you soon. He's only here for part of the year."

That night, while I was working on homework in Kim's office, I asked my assembled colleagues who Zeke Gray was. Kim and the others shook their heads.

Kim had an older office mate named Alice. She was the teaching assistant for hydrogeochemistry, and she often helped us with our homework. She had her own classes to worry about, though, so she usually just sat at her desk with her back to us. But when Alice heard my question, she turned around with a grin.

"You're gonna have Doctor Gnome on your committee?" she asked.

"Um, is that Zeke Gray?"

"Yeah, Ezekiel Gray, AKA Doctor Gnome. He's a sedimentary geologist, and he was the department head about a hundred years ago. He's the really old, weird-looking guy you see every once in a while."

"What does he look like?"

"Like a gnome. He's kind of..." She looked at me nervously, like she might be about to put her foot in her mouth. I could guess what she was about to say. "Kind of short and bald. And really old. If he had a pointy red hat and a big beard, he'd look just like a gnome."

Abby, the dreamy hippy with the manganese nodules, cocked her head. "How can he look like a gnome if he doesn't have a beard or a pointy red hat?"

"Yeah," I said, "Don't those things kind of define the gnome image?"

Alice looked frustrated. "I dunno. He just looks like a gnome who shaves."

Kim asked, "What's gnome?"

Alice, who clearly was sorry she had brought up the subject of gnomes, held her hand two feet above the floor and said, "They're little guys with beards and pointy red hats."

I doubt that Kim felt satisfied with that answer, but she didn't pursue it. Instead, she asked, "Does he teach?"

Alice said, "Only in the summer. He's an emeritus, so he can pretty much do whatever. He goes away in the winter."

I was a little worried about this part. I asked, "How can he be on my committee if he's not around?"

Alice frowned and thought for a second. "I dunno. I don't think he's on anyone's committee. He definitely doesn't have any of his own grad students. I don't think he even does research anymore. Parker had him for field camp -- Parker came out here for field camp when he was at Oberlin -- and he said he was really freaky."

I met Zeke two days later. When I walked into his office, I immediately saw why he was called Doctor Gnome. He was not only beardless but entirely hairless, yet his rotund physique and wrinkled, pudgy face were distinctly gnomish. He was like Santa Claus in miniature, but without the beard. He dressed the way J.R.R. Tolkein might have dressed, in a tweed suit that he must have picked up in London in 1954. I think it even had patches on the elbows. I expected him to pull out a pipe and start blowing smoke rings.

When I walked in, he stood up and offered his hand. He was so short that he still looked like he was sitting down. His Santa eyes twinkled, and I immediately liked him. He kind of reminded me of my grandmother, though I don't remember her very well, and I wondered if he had voyageur genes, too. He even had the same bizarre accent as my grandmother. I used to think it was a French Canadian accent, but I know now that it's really more Downeast Maine than French.

After politely inviting me to sit down, he said, "I heah you'h a Graahvenuh boy."

I smiled blankly for a second while I translated what he'd said. When I figured out that it meant "I hear you're a Grosvenor boy," I said, "Um, I guess I'm a quarter Grosv... Grosvenerian, or something."

He chuckled. "Which quatuh is it?"

"Um, my grandmother."

"Do ya know I'm from Graahvnuh?"

For a split second, I lost my composure. My jaw dropped, and I immediately closed it and tried to act normal. If Grosvenor was as inbred as Tom and Hank seemed to think, that would make Doctor Gnome one of my relatives.

"Um... no." I desperately tried to think of something else to say. "I've never met anyone from Grosvenor. Except my grandmother, I mean."

"What's huh name?"

"Um, my grandmother's name?"

He chuckled again. "Of couase!"

"Marguerite. Her maiden name was DuFresne."

Zeke smiled broadly. "Aaaaah! I knoughuh."

I wasn't sure if he meant "I knew her" or "I know her." I wondered if he was so old that he couldn't distinguish between the past and the present. Either way, I was a little weirded out by the idea that he knew my grandmother. I thought he must be delusional, or he just assumed that he knew my grandmother but really didn't. However, the next thing he said made it clear that he wasn't imagining things.

"She maaried Ahch Gustavson, right?"

My grandfather's name was indeed Arch Gustavson. I was stunned. I nodded and smiled.

"So Madeleine must be youh muthah!" His smile was getting bigger by the second.

I wasn't sure how to tell him that my mother was dead. "She was, yes," I said.

Zeke was undaunted. He laughed and said, "They come down Graahvnuh way a few times aftuh she was boahn. She was the cutest thing! We wuh all sad to heah she'd passed away."

I was starting to think he knew more about my family than I did. "How did you know them?"

"Oh, I knew Mahguerite from way bayack, and Ahch was one of my students."

I tried to do the math and estimate how long he'd been teaching, but the numbers I came up with were too improbable. This guy must have been weaned on mammoth meat.

"Y'evuh been theah?"

"To Grosvenor? No."

"Ah, that's too bad. I heah youh muthuh went off on 'er own and nevuh looked back."

"Uh, yeah. She never really talked about Grosvenor."

"Well, you should get down theyuh. See wheuh ya come from."

"Yeah, I think I'll go down there soon."

He sat and grinned at me for a while as his chuckles subsided. He had to let his mirth settle before he moved on to the next subject.

"So," he asked, "yoah wuhkin' on a project with Hank?"

"Yeah, we're gonna try to model glacial flow."

He nodded. "You gonna use the UMaine model?"

"What's that?"

"The Climate Change Centuh in Orono has a model like that. They've been doin' that stuff foah yeahs."

Now he was giving me a totally different kind of shock. I really thought I was working on something totally new. All I could say was, "Huh. I'll check that out."

"Ah ya lookin' at a pahticulah study area?"

"I, um, I don't know yet." I suddenly felt like I didn't know anything about my own thesis project. I had been reading up on glaciology and computer modeling, but I was at a loss to say what my project was actually about.

Fortunately, he was a kind man. He said, "Well, you'll know moah when I come back in the spring. Did they tell you I'm a snowbuhd?"

"Um, I heard you only teach in the summer."

"Yeah." A smile wrinkled his eyes. "Have ya huhd the one about the guy who lived on the New Hampshah line?"

"No, I don't think so."

He chuckled. "An old Mainuh lived by the New Hampshah line away up nowuth. One day a state suhveyah come through and said, 'I hate to tell you this, but the state line runs just east uh youah house. You live in New Hampshah.' The old man said, 'Oh, thank goodness! I don't think I could take another Maine wintuh.'" With that, Zeke leaned back in his chair and laughed so hard I thought his stomach might burst.

After the laugh subsided, he said, "Yeah, I just stay fo' the wahm weather now. I'm too old to stay heah in the wintuh.

"Now if I know Hank, he's keepin' you on a need-to-know basis." He looked at me sideways and winked. "He nevuh gives anythin' away. He's always worryin' that somebody'll steal his ideas. But between you and me..." He looked around conspiratorially, leaned forward, and said in a croaky whisper, "He's never had one wuhth stealin'." He laughed and stared at me again.

I thought Hank seemed like a pretty intelligent person, and I had nothing against him. I tried to maintain a neutral expression and not indicate agreement.

"So, have ya decided who'll be on youah committee?"

"Um, no. I mean, Hank will be my thesis advisor, but of course he's an adjunct, so Tom is my academic advisor. I think that means Tom will chair my committee, and I need one more regular professor. Tom said something about a geochemist, but I don't know why."

"Elliot? I don't think he'd be relevant to youah project. How about if I join youah committee instead? Oah you can have the both of us. Theyuh's no uppah limit on committee membuhship."

"Oh, I think you, Hank, and Tom would be fine. Does an emeritus count as a regular professor?"

"Shuah! They let me get away with anythin' around heah."

"Do you want me to give you reports or anything?"

"I was meanin' to talk to ya about thayut. I'm gonna email you a list of questions I'd like ya ta think about durin' the wintuh. Just to help ya get in the right frame of mind foah this glaciah project. You don't need to discuss 'em with Hank; just keep him on a..." He winked. "Need-to-know basis."

I didn't know what the hell he was talking about, but I nodded.

Zeke continued, "I think it's good to have moah than one puhspective. It's good to have fresh ideas from different people."

"Yeah, I agree." I still didn't know what he was talking about, but it sounded agreeable enough.

That night, in Kim and Alice's office, I groaned, "He's batty! He's out of his freakin' gourd!"

Everybody was fascinated. None of them had ever had a conversation with Zeke before, and they all wanted to know what it was like.

"We agreed that he'd be on my committee, and then he said all this weird shit about Hank keeping me in the dark and us keeping Hank in the dark and... I don't know. He said he's going to send me a list of questions to think about during the winter. God only knows what'll be on it."

Alan, who was another first year student, asked, "What's Hank keeping you in the dark about?"

"I don't know. He seems really open, actually. But when Zeke started asking me questions about the project, I felt like I didn't know anything about it. I'm sure it's not intentional. I mean, I'm sure Hank isn't trying to be secretive. I probably just haven't figured it all out yet."

Alice said, "Do you know Mitch? He used to have Hank as an advisor. He says Hank was really paranoid about giving out information."

I didn't understand. "You mean, Hank was his advisor, and now he isn't? How could that happen?"

Alice shrugged. "They had some kind of falling out, and he changed advisors. He had to start a whole new project. That's why Mitch has been here so long. He's been here for, like, four years."

"Wow," said Abby. "That would be like getting divorced or something."

Alice nodded. "Yeah, I guess it really sucked."

Alan asked, "What else did Zeke say?"

I cringed. "He's from the same town as my grandmother. He even knew my mom when she was little. I'm not sure, but... I think we might even be related."

What happened next was disturbing. Everybody glanced at each other and then looked at me again. They looked uncomfortable and expectant at the same time, like they didn't know what to say and just hoped that I would say something first. It was suddenly, manifestly clear that I was the last person in Wallace Hall to figure out that I had something in common with Doctor Gnome. They had all noticed the resemblance, and they had just been waiting for me to see it.

"Lemme guess, you're not surprised that Zeke and I are from the same inbred town."

Alice grimaced. "Not really. I mean, you kind of have that look."

"The gnome look?"

Alan offered, "Maybe more of a kobold look."

"What the hell is a kobold?"

"They're the German version of gnomes. They live underground, and they're sort of like evil dwarves."

"Thanks, Alan! I'd much rather be an evil dwarf than a beardless gnome."

Abby laughed. "It's not like we have anything against gnomes or kobolds or whatever. It's just the way you are, like having brown eyes or red hair or whatever. I mean, that's cool. Whatever." Everyone nodded.

We all sat and looked at each other in silence. Then Kim, in halting English, asked if anyone understood what Dianna had said that day about iron oxidation states. Alice quickly turned back to her desk, and the rest of us were happy to go back to digging through our notes.

The next day, Zeke sent me his list of questions. In his email, he asked me not to share them with anyone, though he didn't explain what there was to be secretive about. The list was a mix of dispiriting technical questions that made me realize how little I knew and bizarrely irrelevant questions that he seemed to have pulled out of his ass. Here they are:

* What is the timing of glacial advances and retreats? What part of the cycle are we in now?

* If an ice sheet was one kilometer thick, what would be the temperature and pressure at its base?

* Who was Arctodus simus?

* Where were New England's Native Americans in the nineteenth century?

* What variables typically go into a glacial flow model? What assumptions must be made?

* What is a nunatak?

* What are Clovis points? Where are they found?

* Where is your study area?

* How did the Scarborough mammoth get there?

* On what scale will you model glacial flow? What boundary conditions will you use?

* What are coproliths?

* What is an ecomorph?

* Where did the word "adebaskedon" come from?

* What is Wisconsin Dells?

* How did the sea level in Maine during the last glaciation compare with today's sea level?

* Who lived on Coats Island?

* Who were the Moriori?

* Compare and contrast the geology of the Grosvenor area with that of the Bandelero Mine.

* What did voyageurs look like?

As you may have guessed, the Bandelero Mine was the mine that my grandfather ran. Discussing its geology sounded more like a trip down memory lane than an academic exercise.

I felt like I was being teased by an erudite but senile great uncle. I couldn't understand half the questions, but I was sure they were silly. And the last one was obviously meant to annoy me.

In his email, Zeke added that he would soon be going out of town, so I'd have all winter to think about the questions. He didn't specify when he'd be back.

I wondered how it would affect my academic career if one of my committee members turned out to be insane or senile.
