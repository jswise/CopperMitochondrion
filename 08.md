# Chapter 8

The day before Thanksgiving, I rented several movies and bought a jar of the best salsa I could find in Gabbro Falls. I knew that no one would be around on Thanksgiving, either at Puppet House or on campus, so I decided to spend the day lounging around the house.

I ended up doing so much lounging that I didn't have time to watch the movies. I read a book that had nothing to do with my thesis, went out in the canoe for a little while, and made the closest approximation to good Mexican food that I could come up with in Maine.

I also called my father. I'm not sure how many football games there are on Thanksgiving, but I think he was spending the whole day watching them. I told him I was thinking about going to Grosvenor the next day.

"Oh, good!" he said. "You prob'ly don't remember it, do you?"

"Remember what? Grosvenor?"

"Yeah!"

"I've never been to Grosvenor."

"Yeah you have. You were only a toddler, though. I remember it was right after you stopped nursing."

"After I what?"

"Stopped nursing – you know, breastfeeding! Your Grams took you out there as soon as you were old enough to be away from your mom."

"You mean, you and Mom didn't come?"

"No, it was just you and Grams. You prob'ly met all your relatives on her side. It's a shame we don't know who they are now."

I wondered if I had met Zeke. It would freak me out if Zeke told me he had known me since I stopped breastfeeding.

"Why didn't you and Mom come?"

"Your mom had been to Grosvenor before and hated it. She was born in Arizona, you know, but she had been up there a couple times with Grams and Grampie. I think your mom and Grams fought about taking you, and your mom finally gave up and let her. I didn't get involved."

"Wow. I don't remember that at all."

"Yeah, I wouldn't think you would."

"Have you ever been there?"

"Nope. I've just seen pictures. I don't really know anything about Grosvenor."

"I guess you can't tell me what sights to see."

"Nope. Oh, hey, I think we've got a picture of you there. I'll scan it and send it to you."

"Really?"

"Yeah. You know that one of you and Grams and some other people standing in front of a motel?"

"Yeah, I've seen it. I thought that was from Yellowstone."

"No, Grams didn't go to Yellowstone. That was just us. Hold on a sec." I imagined him cradling the cordless phone while he pulled out the photo album. "Here it is. It's you and Grams, and I think that's your Great Aunt Margaret, but I'm not sure. It's a shame I didn't write it down while she was alive. Margaret's holding a baby; I think that was her granddaughter. Your second… er, first cousin once removed, or whatever you call that. I think they hoped you'd grow up and be friends."

After we talked, he emailed me the picture. It was square and had round corners, like it was shot in some weird 1970s format. We were standing in front of a red building that appeared to be a motel. In the background, I could see a square car and one of those really ugly Mustangs that they made in the '70s.

It was weird to think that I had met my great aunt and didn't remember her. It was even weirder to think that my second cousin, or whatever she was, might still be in Grosvenor, catching lobsters or making concrete or whatever people do there. Most likely, she was eating turkey or watching football at that moment. She probably spoke with a Maine accent. I wondered if she knew that she had a long lost relative from Arizona.

The next morning, I saw Eleanore's car in the driveway. I had slept through her arrival. While I was reading in the dentist chair, she emerged from the crinkly hallway and made coffee. She had been growing her hair out for a little while, and she no longer looked like a tennis ball. Her hair was about half an inch long, with bright green tips and mousy brown roots.

"Morning," I said.

"Hey."

"I didn't know you were coming home so soon."

She yawned. "Yeeeeeaoooooh.  All my relatives are there. It's the definition of a clusterfuck."

"Wow! So, if somebody says the word 'clusterfuck,' I should think of a house full of Eleanore's relatives?"

"Yep."

"Is 'clusterfuck' one word or two?"

"One."

"So, you didn't want to sleep in a clusterfuck?"

"I was assigned to the couch, and I didn't wanna have kids come in at six o'clock in the morning and jump on me. I just drove home instead."

"You wanna go to Grosvenor?"

She wiggled her head and backed up a little to let me know that I had said something random. "Grosvener? Sure. What's in Grosvener?"

"Um, a couple things. My thesis and my family."

"Your family's in Grosvenor?"

"Well, not the ones I know. My grandmother was from there."

"Huh." For a split second, she looked at me as if she was evaluating me. Then she poured her coffee.

"It's also the study area for my thesis."

"Your glacier model and stuff?"

"Yeah."

"What are you gonna do there?"

"I dunno. Just see it. I haven't been there since I… um, since I was little. I don't remember it."

"Sure. This is the day when everyone goes shopping, right? At least nobody'll be shopping in Grosvenor."

***

I hadn't realized how bleak Grosvenor would be. Driving in, the first thing you see is a small railyard full of box cars and coal cars. The next thing you see is a big, coal-fired power plant with huge piles of coal next to it, and then you see the cement factory. Eleanore told me the power plant was a notorious polluter, and the cement plant had a reputation for producing both smoke and dust.

Next came the quarry, which was huge. I couldn't see down into it, but I could see the far wall. I could see where the limestone graded into marble, and I could see the granite at the far end. It was a great cross section, and it would be a great place to study. You could write a whole thesis about that exposure. Geologists, as you may know, get very excited about exposed rocks.

Beyond the quarry, we went down a hill, and there was a sad little picnic area with a sign that read "Wolmaquill Falls." This must be where the river gets past the dike and back into marble and limestone. A little beyond the falls, we came into town.

People are always talking about what a hot real estate market the coast of Maine is, but the boom must have missed Grosvenor. I guess by the time people drive by the power plant and the cement plant, they're not really interested in staying. The reputation for inbreeding probably doesn't help, either. Whatever the reason, the town looked derelict.

The road reached the harbor and turned left, and I figured this was downtown. I wasn't sure where to stop, because nothing looked inviting. I pulled into a small parking lot in front of a grocery store, since it seemed like as good a place to park as any. "Let's get out and walk around," I said. Eleanore didn't say anything.

When I got out of the car, I saw a kid with an eyebrow ring and a green apron pushing grocery carts. He had a small bald spot that was sunburned. Eleanore got out and looked around nervously. "Where do you wanna go?" she asked.

"Oh, I dunno. Let's go down to the water."

Near the entrance to the grocery store, two women with toddlers in shopping carts were chatting. One of them had her back turned, and I saw her turn around briefly to look at us.

We walked back up the street to the harbor, where a bunch of boats were tied up at a pier. There were seagulls everywhere, just like in movies, and there was a weird smell, like salty mud and dead fish. On top of the pier was a huge stack of what looked like green cages.

"What are those?" I asked.

"What?"

"Those green things over there, in big stacks."

"Seriously?"

"Yes, they're seriously green and seriously stacked."

"You really don't know what those are?"

"Should I?"

"They're lobster traps. You see 'em in every harbor. They wash up on the beach, too."

"I've never seen a harbor, except when I drove by one on the freeway."

"You don't get out much."

"I don't get out of Arizona much. I thought lobster cages were made of wood and kind of round on top."

"Those are the old kind. People only use those for decoration. You see them on people's lawns and stuff. Nobody catches lobsters with those."

"Huh. So, are those lobster boats?"

Eleanore laughed. "Yeah. See the little crane and the gap in the side? That's where they haul up the…" she pointed at the pier and enunciated, like it was a vocabulary word, "…lobster traps."

"I get it."

We continued up the road, away from the harbor now. The town still looked uninviting. Only a few people were walking around, and they all kept glancing at us. It seemed like all of them were short and bald.

I was still thinking about lobster traps. "So…"

"Yeah?"

"Dare I ask another lobster trap question?"

"Dare on."

"Okay, when they go out in the little boat and pick up those big, green traps, where do they put them? I mean, is the boat overflowing with traps and ready to capsize when they come back in?"

"No, they don't carry 'em on the boats."

"Then how do they carry them? And what happens after they haul the lobster traps up with the little boom, or crane, or whatever it's called?"

Eleanore made her thinking scowl. "They haul them up, and then they take the lobsters out…"

"You've never actually seen them do it, have you?"

"No, I just eat 'em. Oh, I know! They put the traps back, so they can catch more lobsters. They haul up the trap, take the lobster out, put some more bait in, and put it back in the water."

I nodded. "That's plausible." Then, after a minute, I said, "But it still doesn't explain how they get the traps out there in the first place."

"They have a service for that. A lobster trap service."

"Seriously?"

"I don't fuckin' know! Go find a lobsterman and tell him you're from Arizona and wanna know all about those green, square things."

We had reached an area where scraggly houses stood beside the road. Behind the houses on our left, I could see big, brick buildings with broken windows. A couple big smokestacks sprouted among them.

I pointed at the buildings. "Are those old factories?"

"Those are the mills," she said. "It's a mill town."

I was skeptical. "What did they process?"

"Process? I dunno. They prob'ly made shoes or something. They're not processing anything now."

I was confused, but I didn't pursue it. To me, a mill was a place where people smelted ore to produce metals. I would later learn that in Maine, a mill is any kind of factory that was once powered by water. The mills in Grosvenor were just downstream from Wolmaquill Falls, which would make sense for water power. I would also learn that a "mill town" is a depressed community full of uneducated people and pregnant teenagers.

While I was wondering what Eleanore thought a mill was, I saw something I recognized across the street. "Holy shit!" I said. "That's the motel."

Eleanore looked back and forth between me and the motel. "Yes," she said, "it's a motel."

"Oh yeah, I didn't tell you about the picture." I pulled a folded, eight and a half by eleven inch piece of paper out of my pocket. I opened it and showed her a printout of the picture my father had sent. "That's me, when I was little. This is my grandmother, and my great aunt, and my cousin or something. And that's the motel!"

"Rad!" She took the paper and held it up. "It looks a little nicer in the picture."

In real life, the motel was boarded up. The changeable sign read "CLO ED FOR THE SEA5ON." A single car with a flat tire sat in the parking lot.

Most of the motel was just one floor, but there was a second story residence at one end, where the owners had presumably lived. The residence wasn't boarded up, but that might have just been because it was high. It was hard to tell if anyone lived there. The motel might have been closed for years.

"Yeah," I said, "it's pretty sad."

We turned around and started walking back.

After a minute, Eleanore asked, "Why did you and your gramma stay at a motel if you were visiting relatives? Wouldn't they let you stay with them?"

"God only knows. I don't remember the trip at all."

"Did your great aunt own the motel?"

I thought about this for a while. "Maybe," I said. "Until recently, I thought that picture was from Yellowstone Park." I stopped, turned around, and looked at the motel. "I never wondered why we stayed there. I don't even know if we did."

Eleanore pointed. "Maybe you slept in that little upstairs part. You were prob'ly in a playpen or something in there. You prob'ly screamed and screamed 'cause your mom wasn't there, and then your great aunt gave your gramma advice about how to get you to be quiet. Maybe they fed you chocolate or something. Maybe they were worried you'd wake the customers up." She scowled. "If there were any customers."

Then she had another thought and looked at me. "I know! You were such a freakin' crier that you couldn't stay at your relatives' house, so you had to stay at a motel. Your relatives told your gramma, 'You just go stay at the motel, and we'll come visit in the morning.'"

"You've got this whole scenario all worked out, huh?"

"Oh, yeah. You prob'ly drove 'em nuts."

"Thanks!"

We turned and started walking away from the motel again. Then Eleanore said, "I wonder who does stay at that motel."

"Nobody, anymore."

"Yeah, but I mean when it was open. Jeez, maybe you and your gramma stayed there just so it wouldn't be empty."

We passed a family with a dog. The whole family was short and pale, and both parents were pretty much bald. The dog was bigger than the kids and pure white. It looked powerful but friendly. I nodded at the parents and said, "Howdy." They nodded back but looked kind of skeptical.

After we passed them, I noticed that Eleanore had stepped off the curb and was walking in the street. She came back to the sidewalk, glancing nervously back at the family and their dog. She quietly made a little twanging sound with her mouth that sounded like the first few notes of "Dueling Banjos." Then she asked, "Did you see that dog?"

"Yeah, it was cute."

"Are you shitting me? I thought that dog was gonna kill me. Did you see the way it looked at me?"

"No. How did it look at you?"

"Like it would rip my throat out if I got any closer."

"Maybe that's just the dog's natural expression. I didn't notice anything unusual."

"That's 'cause it wasn't looking at you. It musta known you were a Grosvenor boy."

I laughed. "I doubt it. I don't think dogs can tell where your family comes from."

We walked in silence for a while. I studied the buildings, trying to figure out how this town looked different from other towns. There weren't many people on the street, and I could tell that just about all of them either glanced at us or outright stared at us. I think Eleanore was staring back at them.

In a low voice, hoping no one would eavesdrop, I said, "I think I know why this town is so dreary."

"Is it the pollution or the inbred ambience?"

"There aren't any tourist places, unless you count the motel. There aren't any art galleries or ice cream shops. Look – there's a bank, and an appliance repair shop, and a barber shop… they're all just things that locals need. I mean, I'm not saying it should be all tacky and touristy, but a 'Welcome' sign would help."

"That would just make it worse. It would look like bait."

"What, like it's a trap? Like, come to our town so we can eat you?"

"Uhhhhhh-huh. Those aren't really lobster traps, you know. They're tourist traps."

We went by the harbor and back to the car.

"Is there anything else you want to do before we leave?" I asked.

"Uhhhhh, no." She quickly got in the car.

I got in a little more slowly. "It seems like a shame to drive here and then just drive back," I said. "You wanna see anything else?"

"I just wanna get out of here."

"Okay." I started the car. As I drove out of the parking lot and up the street, I said, "Is it because they're staring at us? They're prob'ly just not used to seeing any tourists. Having green hair prob'ly makes a difference, too."

"Are you shitting me?"

I was surprised at her reaction. "Well... no. I mean, no offense -- I like your hair -- but don't people stare at you in other places?"

"Ian, they weren't staring at us. They were staring at you."

"Whaddo you mean? I look pretty normal around here."

"Exactly! You look like them, but they've never seen you before. It weirds them out. They're trying to figure out who you are."

After the motel and before the falls, I saw a gas station. "I need gas," I said, and I pulled in.

"Don't let them eat you," said Eleanore.

"I won't."

The gas pump was old and had no credit card reader. After I pumped the gas, I asked Eleanore if she wanted anything (of course not), and I went inside.

Unlike the shiny convenience stores that I was used to seeing, this place was a miniature grocery store with dim lighting. A woodstove sat near the front of the store, with some chairs, a small table, and a coffeemaker nearby. The whole back wall of the store was taken up by a cooler containing beer and basic groceries. The rest of the store was filled by chest-high shelves with narrow aisles between them.

The lady at the counter was about four and a half feet tall and very friendly. She was probably about fifty years old, but the faint wisps of hair on her head made her look about a hundred. I asked her where the bathroom was, and she said I'd need to go out the front and around the side.

At many gas stations, they hand you a key with a large object attached to it, such as a one-by-two with "MEN" written on it. However, this lady didn't give me anything. I stood there for a second and then asked, "Do I need a key or something?"

She tilted her head and gave me the smile that she reserved for contrite grandchildren and naive city folk. "No, Hon, we don't lock it."

When I walked outside, I noticed a local guy pumping gas into a big pickup truck. He wasn't paying any attention to Eleanore.

I walked around the corner, and two weird things happened that made me think I was dreaming. The first weird thing was the the building was just too long. Apparently, the store inside only took up half the building, so viewed from the outside, the building just seemed a lot longer than it needed to be. The second thing that happened was that the weird gas station building suddenly reminded me of a dream. I couldn't really remember the dream, but I knew it was a dream I'd had a long time ago, and it involved a gas station and fear. Soon I would have that dream again, but I'll get to that.

After I finished in the bathroom, we drove out of town. Eleanore relaxed, pulled up a map on her cellphone, and looked for interesting places to go.

"Ooh!" she said. "Can we go to Mount Sheffield?"

"Sure. What's at Mount Sheffield?"

"We used to drive by it when I was little. You can ride a ski lift up to the top, even in the summer, and they have a restaurant up there."

"That sounds expensive."

She thought about this and then sighed. "Yeah." She looked at the map again. "There's a road to the top, too. Maybe you don't have to ride the lift and buy expensive food. Go past the lift about half a mile, and take a left."

I've never seen billboards in Maine, which is kind of weird when I think about it. They must be illegal. Instead of billboards, they have little signs that the Department of Transportation apparently puts up. They're all basically identical, and they come in stacks, maybe four to a post. Each sign has a little pictogram, the name of a business, and an arrow. We saw one now with a little picture of a mountain and the words "MOUNT SHEFFIELD TRAM 1/4 MILE."

"Let's stop and see how much it costs," I said. "It might be fun."

Eleanore looked giddy, and I felt like I was her father. It was weird.

We pulled into a crowded parking lot. I could see that the place was an old ski area, with ski runs cut through the trees on the mountainside. But saplings covered the runs like a five o'clock shadow, and there were several abandoned buildings at the edge of the parking lot. Beside one of them, an ancient Snow Cat sat and rusted. Evidently, the place was a lot more successful as a restaurant than a ski area. I couldn't imagine that they got much snow, and the mountain didn't seem especially large, at least compared to those in Arizona.

I dodged a few tourists and pulled into a parking space just as someone else was pulling out of it. Then we went and bought tickets, which turned out to be pretty cheap. The tickets came with several coupons to use on top of the mountain, so we'd be sure to stick around and spend some more money.

It was strange to ride a ski lift when there was no snow. It also felt weird to do it without a snowboard strapped to one foot. We glided over the stubbly trees and got rather chilly in the November breeze.

The restaurant looked like a small, Swiss village sitting on a concrete pedestal. The place had a sort of aboveground basement with no windows, presumably to hold the restaurant above the snow. The ski lift terminated in the largest structure in the village, a tall, concrete monolith that hid the lift's motor. The fake village was surrounded by large decks, and the basement was so wide that it supported the decks as well as the buildings. The deck on the right was particularly large, and a big radio tower stood nearby. I suspected that the radio tower's equipment resided under the deck, which would explain why the deck had a basement and not just posts to hold it up. The whole place looked like an industrial building in disguise as a tacky Christmas decoration.

We approached the top of the lift, which was in the center of the village. The structure that hid the lift's motor was a lot bigger than it really needed to be -- it was three or four stories tall. At the bottom were two big holes, one where the chairs went in and one where the chairs came out. Someone had stuck fake windows and doors on the rest of it in a pathetic attempt to make it look like a Swiss chalet.

We glided over the deck in front of the chalet, and somehow the chair stopped moving. The cable -- or what ski industry people call the "wire rope" -- was still moving, but the chair had let go of it. A young Jamaican guy helped us off the chair and ushered us out of the landing zone. Then, somehow, the chair gripped the wire rope and lurched forward. As we went through a gate, I turned around to see the chair disappear into the chalet. It clanked violently in the darkness and reemerged, ready to pick up more passengers and head down the mountain.

Eleanore grinned. "I always wanted to come here when I was little. We would drive by it every once in a while, and I would always beg my parents to stop and ride the lift, but we were always in a hurry, or else my parents just didn't want to. Look, you can see the harbor."

We were still pretty close to Grosvenor, and from here we could see the town and its harbor, as well as the cement plant and the power plant. Both had smokestacks with white strobe ligts on them. I could see part of the quarry, but not well enough to write a thesis about it.

We made a circuit around the pretend village, which had all the tacky tourist shops that Grosvenor lacked. I used my coupon to buy some taffy, and Eleanore bought a Mount Sheffield shot glass. I realized that Grosvenor does have a tourism industry, but it's concentrated on top of the mountain. Evidently, the people in Grosvenor prefer to keep their tourists at arm's length.

We headed down the mountain, which turned out to be a shock. I've ridden up lots of ski lifts, but I found out that riding down is a whole different experience. Instead of looking at the mountain, you're looking out at empty space, seemingly with nothing under you. It was kind of terrifying, to be honest.
