# Chapter 12
        My father sent a big box of my grandfather's stuff, and I spent an evening studying the old mine plans in my office.  It was fun to think that I was doing the same thing in grad school that I had done when I was little.  Of course, I was only doing it because I had a batty professor, but it was fun anyway.
        I didn't actually know much about the mine.  I had been there once when I was very young, and I had a dim memory of old buildings and a headframe, which is the structure that goes on top of a shaft.  I didn't get to go down the shaft, because children weren't allowed in the mine.
        Looking at the plans, I wasn't sure where the headframe would have been.  I saw two small airshafts and some other shafts that didn't go up to the surface.  Only one big shaft reached the surface, and it was right next to the adit, the main entrance to the mine.  That must have been where I was, since it would make sense for my grandfather's office and the other buildings to be there.  I must not have noticed the adit at the time, possibly because my parents kept me away from it.  There must have also been a big pile of waste rock, but I probably hadn't paid attention to it.
        This was the first time I had looked at the plans since I had grown up and learned about geology.  I saw for the first time that they weren't actually very informative, at least from a geological perspective.  They showed where all the tunnels and stuff were, which I suppose was the point, but they didn't give the names of the rock formations or much information about the veins.  There were just some vague marks and comments indicating granite, limestone, and ore.  Maybe the plans were just rough drafts, and he had traced them onto a nicer set to send to the investors back east.
        The mine seemed to follow both sides of a granitic dike that had intruded into limestone, which meant that the rock they were mining was probably heavily metamorphosed limestone â€“ in other words, it was marble, even though the plans called it limestone.  I suppose copper miners probably don't care about the difference between limestone and marble.
        A long, straight tunnel on a lower level seemed to follow the axis of the dike.  In other words, it stayed in the middle of the granite, while the other parts of the mine were around the edges of the granite.  Tunneling through granite would be slower and more expensive than tunneling through marble or limestone, and it looked like they hadn't found any veins of ore in there.  Sometimes, miners will tunnel all the way to the other side of a mountain if there's a railroad track or a mill or some other worthwhile destination, even if they don't expect to find ore along the way.  I wondered if they needed to get somewhere and had dug through the granite because it was more stable than the surrounding rock.
        Looking at the plans reminded me that I hadn't studied Grosvenor geology yet.  Late that evening, I decided I may as well start learning about it, so I could compare it to the Bandalero Mine and get one of Zeke's questions out of the way.
        Each door in the basement had a little, orange sign with a room number.  One door had an additional orange sign that read "LIBRARY."  I had never been in there or seen the door open, but I had occasionally heard people go in and out while I was in my office.  Hank had explained that the library was full of information about Maine geology.  It held every geologic map the Bureau had ever published, along with a lot of journals and manuscripts and a few books.  He had warned me that since there was no librarian, there was a strict rule against removing anything from the room.  Another rule said that anyone who didn't have a key to the library had to be supervised.
        Fortunately, I had a key, so I could go in there in the middle of the night.  I decided to take advantage of my privileged access by going to the library barefoot.  I picked up my clipboard and my keys and padded down the hall.
        The library was a windowless room about twice the size of my office.  One of its fluorescent lights flickered and buzzed loudly.  There were a lot of flat files, which are cabinets with wide, shallow drawers for holding maps and other large pieces of paper.  There were a few shelves and a lot of file cabinets.  A photocopier and a small, empty desk sat next to the door.  Nearby was an even smaller desk with a computer on it, and next to that was a plotter, which you can think of as a really wide printer.  I assumed the computer would help me find things, so I turned it on and tossed my clipboard onto the empty desk.
        After the computer booted up, I found that the computer had a GIS-based filing system for the maps.  GIS, which you pronounce by spelling it out rather than as a one-syllable word, stands for "geographic information system."  In addition to searching the way you would in a regular library, this system allowed the user to search geographically by clicking on a map.
        I found Grosvenor, clicked on it, and found a list of geologic maps.  I discovered that someone had scanned the maps, so I could look at them on the computer instead of pulling them out of drawers.  There was also geologic GIS data -- in other words, someone had created a sort of computer-based map that had never been on paper.  It occurred to me that I could probably access the same system from my office, but I had never known about it.
        I wondered how they had scanned such big maps.  I looked around the room to see if there was some kind of large scanner.  Then I peered at the plotter.  You know the things gymnasts call "horses," those big, padded things that they get up and twirl around on?  A plotter is kind of shaped like a gymnast's horse.  It contains a big roll of paper and drops documents into a vertical tray on the front.  This particular plotter looked like two ordinary plotters stacked one on top of the other, and it had its own monitor sticking off the top.  When I looked closely at it, I saw that it was actually a combination plotter and scanner.  I'm a bit of a technophile, so I thought that was pretty cool.
        I spent hours in the library that night.  I looked at the maps and GIS data for a long time, occasionally pulling out paper maps when I couldn't read the details on the scanned images.  Then I skimmed a book for laymen called Roadside Geology of Maine.
        Looking at the book, I got distracted by an interesting story about the Scarborough mammoth.  There's a town in southern Maine called Scarborough, and someone found the tusks and bones of a mammoth there.  Finding mammoth bones isn't too unusual, but the weird thing about this find was that the bones were significantly younger than the sediments in which they were buried.  Also, the sediments were laid down underwater, probably where a glacier met the ocean.  In other words, when the sediments were deposited, it was definitely not the sort of place where you'd find a mammoth.  The mammoth somehow got into the sediments later.  At first I thought the simplest explanation was that prehistoric people had buried the mammoth, though it would take an awful lot of digging.  But the bones were about 10,500 years old, so I thought there probably weren't any people in Maine back then.
        After pulling myself away from Roadside Geology, I pulled out some papers about the Grosvenor area, including the one Zeke had written about the limestone quarry fifty years earlier.  I also found a topographic map, which showed me where the valleys and rivers and things were.  I found out that Mount Sheffield, where Eleanore and I had ridden the tram, was the eroded top of a pluton, a mass of granite that had formed underground before being exposed.  The dike that crossed the valley below the cement plant was part of the same intrusion, and it radiated southeast from the pluton.
        There were definitely some similarities between the geology of the Bandalero Mine and Grosvenor.  I could see why Zeke had wanted me to compare them, and  I was glad to see that it wasn't just a totally random request.
        I retrieved my grandfather's plans from my office and fed them into the scanner.  I did this partly so I could make a nice little presentation for Zeke but mainly just because it was fun.
        The computer had GIS editing software, so I decided to try overlaying the main level of the mine on the Grosvenor data, just to see how they'd match up.  Fortunately, I had taken a GIS class as an undergrad, so I had some idea of what I was doing.  I brought up my scanned image of the mine on the screen along with the Maine GIS data, then I moved the Bandalero plan to the Grosvenor area.  I shrank the plan and rotated it, trying it in different places to see how it would fit.  It fit surprisingly well in an area just southwest of the Lamarck cement plant's quarry, where the dike crossed the valley.  I fiddled with the plan and found a way to make it translucent, so I could see a faint image of the plan on the underlying GIS data.
        The mine had side branches called "drifts" and "stopes," which were places where the miners followed veins of ore outward and upward from the main tunnels.  Strangely, I found that if I lined one of the drifts in the mine up with one of the geologic faults in the GIS data, the two main tunnels ran along the two sides of the dike, right where the granite met the surrounding rock.
        It seemed a little weird that things would line up like that, so I decided to start over and be a little more anal-retentive about it this time.  I hadn't saved the changes I had made as I moved the image around, so I reloaded the image to put it back where it had started.
        I adjusted the size of the plan until the scalebar was the right length, then I looked at a pair of arrows that I assumed were north arrows.  The plan had surprisingly little text, and there was no "N" on the arrows.  The plan also didn't say which arrow pointed to true north and which arrow pointed to magnetic north.  As you may know, the magnetic north pole is not in the same place as the geographic north pole.  It moves around slowly and unpredictably.  In general, if you're in the western U.S., magnetic north is to the right of true north, and in the eastern U.S., it's to the left of true north.  I rotated the plan until the arrow on the left, which would be true north in Arizona, pointed straight up.  The main tunnels ran from the southeast toward the northwest.
        Now the plan had the right size and orientation and just needed to be put in the right place.  Or rather, it needed to be put in Maine, which is definitely the wrong place for an Arizona mine.  I zoomed in on Grosvenor again and clicked a button that made the plan move to the place where I was looking.  I made the plan translucent and slid it around until the drift was near the fault.
        I could see now that the orientation of the plan didn't match the orientation of the features.  In other words, the fault and the drift didn't run in quite the same direction, and the dike didn't run in quite the same direction as the tunnels.  I moved the plan and tried to line the drift up with another fault that crossed the dike in the GIS data, but it didn't match that one, either.  However, the general layout looked similar, and the spacing of two of the drifts along the mine seemed to match the spacing of the two faults, which was still way too weird.
        I noticed that the angle between the drifts and the faults was similar to the angle between the two north arrows on the plan.  I saved the plan and rotated it again, this time using the arrow on the right, as if the plan had been drawn in Maine instead of Arizona.
        At this point, I started to freak out.  What I saw made me think my grandfather had literally been insane.  This time, the directions matched.  I moved the plan again, and this time both faults matched the drifts.  The two main tunnels of the mine, both of which were kind of squiggly, lined up with the dike again.  The mine plan was much more detailed than the GIS data, so the GIS data made the dike look smooth, while the dike in the plan was rough.  However, it was clear that the dikes were identical.  The adit, or main entrance to the mine, appeared to be at the southwest end of the Lamarck quarry, where Zeke's paper said the limestone graded into fractured marble.
        I loaded another one of my scanned images, the one with the long, straight tunnel.  The plan included a cross-sectional view that showed the angle of the dike, which wasn't quite vertical, and how one of the shafts cut through it to connect the different levels.  I looked up some information about the dike in Maine, and I found that the slope and direction of the dike, or what geologists call strike and dip, matched the dike on the plans.
        I lined the shafts on the lower level up with the shafts on the main level.  The long, straight tunnel ran about where you'd expect the dike to be at that depth, parallel to where the dike appears on the surface.  The tunnel seemed to point toward the pluton to the northwest.
        I briefly wondered if the plans had gotten mixed up.  Maybe this was an old plan of a mine in Grosvenor that was left over from when my grandfather had been in school.  But the plan did say "Bandalero Mine," even though there wasn't much else written on it.  Had he faked it for his thesis?  I couldn't think of any advantage to pretending that a mine in Maine was really in Arizona, especially since his thesis committee would probably know better.  More importantly, nothing in the library indicated that there was any kind of mine adjacent to the quarry.  Come to think of it, Hank wouldn't have come up with this project in the first place if there was a known copper formation in Grosvenor, since the whole point was to find something that nobody else knew about.
        Now I wished I had thought more about the mine while I was still in Arizona.  I wasn't even sure where it was, since I had never been there as an adult.  The plans didn't say what county the mine was in or give any other indication of where it was.
        I went online and downloaded Arizona GIS data from a site I had used as an undergrad.  I was pretty familiar with Arizona geology, so I zoomed in to places where I thought dikes like the one in the plans might exist.  I found several candidates, but none of them looked quite right.
        I tried Googling the mine.  Surprisingly, I got some hits.  Someone had done a survey of abandoned mines to see how polluted they were, and the survey mentioned the Bandalero.   Unfortunately, it didn't say where the mine was.  The mine wasn't dribbling sulfuric acid or any other contaminants, so they just put it on a list and left it at that.  Someone else had written on a blog about driving out in the desert at random, climbing the disintegrating headframe, and getting stoned up there.  That person wasn't sure where she was.  Another person said the mine was anomolous, because it wasn't in one of the well-known copper-producing areas.
        Then it got weird.  I found a master's thesis by someone who had looked at mines in unusual locations to see if they were sitting on underrated ore bodies.  The idea was that if there was a little bit of ore, then maybe there was a lot more ore that people just hadn't found.  The thesis seemed to be describing a different mine with the same name, because it said the mine was in sandstone.  I kept reading anyway, and the author said he had gone through the pile of waste rock outside the mine.  He said the pile was small, and he had found no evidence of copper or any other metal in it.  It was nothing but sandstone.  He wrote, "Geophysical work was deemed unnecessary at this site, as it appeared to be only an exploratory shaft with no minerals of interest."
        Whether the mine in the thesis was my grandfather's mine or not, it was anomolous for more reasons than one.  It's no wonder there was no pollution.  It wasn't a real mine.
        I went back to the GIS website and searched for mines.  I downloaded a GIS file with points for all the known mines in Arizona and information about their pollutants.  Only one mine in the file was called the Bandalero Mine, and sure enough, it was clean.  When I overlayed it on the Arizona geologic data, the mine was on a sandstone formation.
        It was about four o'clock in the morning, and my head was buzzing in synch with the bad fluorescent light.  I printed a map that showed the main level of the Bandalero superimposed on the GIS data, turned off the infernal lights, and left the library.  I folded the map so nobody would see what was on it and dropped it on my desk.  I put my snow boots back on, went outside, and walked slowly in the general direction of my car.
        I tried to boil down everything I'd seen into something logical, which wasn't easy at four o'clock in the morning, especially while I was stressing out about the implications.  I knew that according to the data, there was only one mine in Arizona called the Bandalero, and it had nothing in it.  I had plans of what looked more and more like a fictitious mine.
        There are countless abandoned mines dug by optimists and con artists.  The optimists dig until they go bankrupt.  The con artists sell shares in a mine or sell the whole thing before skipping town.  Some mines, particularly gold mines, produce just enough to keep an optimist from running out of money, while never producing enough to make it really worthwhile.  In a mine like that, you might find one optimist working alone, digging deeper and deeper for decades, always expecting to find a bonanza after the next blast.
        It's rare to find a mine with no hint of valuable minerals.  If you do find one, then you know that whoever dug it either suffered from a severe case of optimism or never had any intention of producing minerals.  As a rule, such a mine would be shallow and wouldn't have any significant buildings or other signs of investment.  A mine that doesn't produce anything at all can't support an optimist or even a con artist for very long.
        The Bandalero didn't seem to fit any of the profiles.  It was apparently totally unprofitable, but somebody had paid my grandfather to work there for a long time, and they had put up those buildings and the headframe.  And if the mine was shallow, then what was he doing all that time?  Did he just sit around drawing plans of an imaginary mine?  For whose benefit did he draw them?
        If the mine was part of a scam, then it had to be a very elaborate scam that lasted a long time.  It clearly didn't involve selling the mine and skipping town.  Maybe the owners, or my grandfather for that matter, had just kept selling shares in the mine indefinitely to gullible rich people who lived far away.  Maybe the mine was nothing more than a stage set for the few investors who travelled all the way to Arizona to see it.
        Then I thought of the stories about people laundering stolen gold by working bogus deposits.  Was my grandfather laundering copper?  Copper is a lot less valuable than gold, so he'd have to launder an awful lot of it to make it worthwhile.  Where could anyone steal a large quantity of copper for a long period of time?  Or maybe it was not stolen but smuggled.  Was my grandfather helping to prop up a foreign dictator by importing shiploads of copper ore?  It sounded romantic but not very ethical or probable.
        I kept coming back to the possibility that he was simply insane.  I imagined a scenario in which somebody bought the mine and then hired my grandfather to run it, and he arrived to find a worthless hole.  He might tell them the truth or lie and make the mine look good, but either way he'd shortly be out of a job.  Maybe he didn't want to tell my grandmother, and he had an inheritance or loans to live on.  He pretended to go to work every day, but he was really just sitting in an office out in the desert and going mad.  In this context, leaving me his slide rule and university pennant seemed like a really twisted thing to do.
        But I knew that my grandmother hated Arizona.  Why wouldn't he have packed up and taken her back to Maine?  He must have had a compelling reason to stay at the mine.  He evidently didn't make much money, regardless of what kind of bizarre or nefarious activities he might have been up to, so he must have had some other motivation.
        No explanation made sense.
