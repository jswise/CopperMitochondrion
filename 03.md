# Chapter 3

Early on Tuesday morning, the day after Labor Day, Eleanore took me to the admissions office so I could get the scoop on starting school. In the midst of a thoroughly confusing conversation with the nice admissions lady, I found out that there was no orientation for graduate students. Apparently, only freshmen and slow-witted transfer students are supposed to need orientation, and grad students are supposed to take care of themselves. I was a little embarrassed when I finally sorted this out.

That afternoon, there was a meeting for all the economic geology grad students and professors. There weren't very many of us – I think there were seven new students, some of whom were starting the Ph.D. program, and there were about ten preexisting students. There were three regular professors and two adjuncts, people who had other jobs and just taught one class.

The department chair got up and introduced himself as Tom Hopkins. I noticed that he didn't call himself "Doctor Hopkins," and I was to learn that all the professors went by their first names. They were pretty confident in their positions, and they didn't feel the need to remind anyone that they had Ph.D.s.

Tom was about sixty, with conservative hair and a khaki shirt, just what you'd expect a geologist to wear in the field. He was friendly but businesslike, sort of like Eleanor.

He told us that forty-eight students had applied to the program, and only seven had been accepted. They liked to keep the program small, he said, and they liked to keep the number of students equal to the number of assistantships. He said they wanted to make sure the students could focus on their work, which basically meant the program was so difficult that anyone who was delivering pizzas at night couldn't hope to survive.

He was pleased to announce that a new assistantship had just been approved, so there were enough assistantships for everybody. My stress level decreased immediately.

Tom also said the faculty expected us to "collaborate with your colleagues," i.e. work together on our homework. I had never heard my fellow students referred to as "colleagues" before, and I had always thought that collaboration was something like cheating. Evidently, the work here was going to be so intense that we couldn't do it alone.

He said that each of us had a mailbox in the geoscience department office, and we should check both it and our email daily. He passed a list around so everybody could write down their email addresses. I was the only one who hadn't already gone to the computer center to establish an account, and I sheepishly told him after the meeting that I would get back to him with my email address. I felt like a slacker, and I wondered if I would miss any crucial emails in the next few hours.

That night was the annual economic geology pool party. The professors brought their families, and several of the students brought spouses and kids as well. A professor named Alan brought a keg of home-brewed beer, and there were hot dogs and pool noodles everywhere.

I stood by myself and awkwardly tried to eat while juggling a paper plate and a cup of beer. Tom, the department chair, approached with one of the adjunct professors, whose name I couldn't remember.

"Hi, Ian," said Tom, as if we had known each other for more than six hours. Since I can barely remember anyone's name, I'm always surprised when someone remembers mine. I muttered a response around a mouthful of hot dog.

He overlooked by uncouth manner and said, "You're one of the people without assistantships, right?"

I swallowed and nodded. "Yes."

"You remember Hank; he's a glaciologist with the Bureau of Mines."

"Sure," I said, although he had pretty well summed up what I didn't remember.

"Hank's got two open assistantships, and I've got one, too. We'll meet tomorrow with you and Abby and Kim, and we'll decide what the best match is for each position."

"Great! When're we meeting?"

"Come to my office at ten o'clock. Just ask Evelyn where it is."

I gathered that Evelyn was the geoscience secretary, and I decided Abby and Kim must be the other students who didn't have assistantships yet.

Hank was a little chubby and about fifty years old. He had a brown mustache that made him look like a cop. He wore a light blue dress shirt with short sleeves, and I could see that he had a white T-shirt under it.

"Where ya from?" he asked.

"Arizona."

"Arizona! Lot of interesting geology there."

"Yep."

"You ever go to Flagstaff?"

"Oh yeah, I go snowboarding around there."

"My sister went to school there, at NAU. That's a nice place."

"Yeah, I like it, too."

Tom joined the chorus of banality. "How do you like the heat out there?"

"Mmm… you get used to it, but I've never liked it much, actually. During the summer, I was a tour guide in a mine, so I got to be underground most of the time." I'm always careful not to say I worked in a mine, since that would sound a lot more hard core than what I actually did.

"Oh, really?" said Tom. "Which mine was it?"

"The Broken Pick. It's a copper mine. It's not active anymore."

"Did you grow up around mines?"

"Not really. My grandfather managed a copper mine. He was an engineer. He went to school here, actually. But he died before I was born, and my mother wasn't into mining."

"Was your grandfather a Mainer?"

"No, but my grandmother was from Grosvenor. They met here at Mines."

By the way, I didn't know how to spell "Grosvenor" at the time. It's pronounced "grovner," and I hadn't yet learned that the names of New England towns are rarely pronounced the same way they're spelled.

Tom grinned. "Oh, so you've got some Maine blood! I hope it helps in the winter."

Hank suddenly looked elated, and I didn't know why. Then he took on a sly expression and asked, "Ever been to Grosvenor?"

"No, I'd never been to Maine until a few days ago. I don't even know where Grosvenor is."

"It's about an hour from here," said Hank. "Go check it out. Just watch out for the locals."

"Why's that?"

"Well…" Hank winked at me. "They don't get out much."

Tom added, "Grosvenor has a reputation for being sort of Maine's answer to hillbillies. It was settled by voyageurs. I don't think they're any stranger than most Mainers, though."

Their lack of tact was astonishing. I mean, they were basically telling me that my grandmother was inbred. Would that make me one quarter inbred? I don't think either one of them recognized the implications of what they were saying, though Tom was obviously uncomfortable with the idea of insulting a whole town.

Hank asked, "Have you seen the rest of New England?"

"No, I've just seen the Mass Pike and I-95."

"You should be sure to see it while you're here. There's a lotta history here. Even Gabbro Falls is an old town. Lotta history."

I just nodded thoughtfully, trying to think of what I could possibly say about the history of Gabbro Falls. "Yeah, I guess there is," I said. "I just know what I learned in high school." I thought of the pilgrims, Paul Revere, and Henry David Thoreau. "It seems like everything happened in Massachusetts."

With a knowing grin, Hank said, "Yeah, even the stuff that happened in Maine happened in Massachusetts."

Tom and I both chuckled politely. I had the feeling that Hank's cryptic statement was meant to be an erudite joke, one that I definitely didn't understand. I think Tom understood the joke but didn't think it was all that clever. Hank kept smiling and looking at me in a pointed way, like he was testing me to find out if I was as smart as he was. It gave me the willies.

Tom offered to introduce me to the other students, which gave me a chance to break away from the tedious conversation. I wondered if Tom was equally relieved to move on, or if he was just doing his job as department head and party host.

At nine o'clock the next morning, I had my first class, hydrogeochemistry. It sounds like something you'd make up if you were trying to think of the most difficult class possible, but this was real.

I had never been much of a note-taker. In high school, I considered doodling to be a viable substitute for taking notes. The teachers went so slowly that there was always time to draw little pictures of what they were talking about. My friends referred to my notes as heiroglyphics. I think I wrote them at a rate of about one page per semester. I don't know if they were effective or not, because I never looked at them.

In college, I had to start writing actual text. I still only wrote about a page per semester, but the ideas were denser on the page. I know a picture is supposed to be worth a thousand words, but it's hard for a picture to convey the words "plagioclase feldspar" (a mineral). Diagrams are appropriate if you're learning about the Krebs cycle or magmatic intrusions, but if you need to remember what the professor wants you to know about the Iliad, you'll need a full-blown comic book. So in each of my college textbooks, I stuffed one page of indecipherable scratchings. When it was time for final exams, I'd pull the page out and think, "What the hell was this supposed to mean? What was I supposed to remember about plagiaclase feldspar?"

I knew graduate school would be more intense than college, so I brought two whole pieces of paper to my first class. I figured we'd spend most of the time talking about the syllabus and getting an overview of what the class would be about, but I thought it would be prudent to have some paper, just in case.

When I arrived at hydrogeochemistry, the professor, Dianna Neubaumer, did indeed pass out a syllabus. This surprised me, because it was only 8:52, and there were were only eight students in the room. It turned out that only eight of us had signed up for the class. Although I didn't know it at the time, only five of us would finish.

At 8:53, Dianna started talking about carbonate chemistry and writing a bunch of chemical equations on the board. I realized that I'd better write something down, and I felt a bit surly about it. I felt as though somebody had called me early in the morning, woken me up, and demanded that I write down their phone number immediately. I wrote, "Carbonate chemistry."

Then I looked at the chemical equations and remembered that although I had taken freshman chemistry, I hadn't bothered to buy the book, much less read it. I could see that Dianna was telling us something about pH, carbon dioxide, and limestone, but that was about all I could get out of it. I decided I'd better write everything down so I could try to figure it out later. When I was halfway through the third line, she erased the board, and I was left wondering if I would ever find out what she had been talking about.

Dianna drew a big graph with three lines that looked like plateaus standing side by side, with their slopes overlapping each other. I diligently copied the graph, oblivious to what she was saying as she drew it. She wrote some equations on the graph, and I wondered if they were the same ones she had erased. I wasn't even sure if they were the same equations I had already written down, and I didn't have time to check.

Pretty soon, I had to ask Brenna, the student next to me, for some paper. It was hard to be inconspicuous about it, considering how small the class was. She calmly popped some paper out of a three-ring binder, gave it to me, and continued with her own notes. She looked like she did this all the time.

After the class, nursing a sore hand, I went to the little meeting to find out who would get which assistantship. By this time, I felt comfortable with my "colleagues" and the professors, having chatted with everybody at the pool party. Even Hank seemed less annoying than he had at first.

Kim was from mainland China, and to this day I don't know if her name is Chinese or if she picked it up when she came to the U.S. Everything about her was reserved and studious. Abby looked like a Deadhead, with long, brownish-blonde hair and Birkenstocks. She always seemed to be looking at something just above my head that only she could see. Whatever she was looking at, it must have been pretty amusing, because she grinned like the Buddha all day.

I was the last one to arrive, and Tom was in the middle of telling a story about something his cat had done. After the punchline, he told us about his projects.

"We've got some geophysical work in Ontario," he said. "I anticipate covering a large area with aerial data, most likely magnetometer and gravimeter data. That'll narrow it down to optimal places for seismic studies, and we might do some borings. The project design will be up to the student. It's a good chance to develop an exploration strategy to cover a big area with minimal fieldwork.

"The other project is really slick. We're going to collaborate with Nininger Minerals and study the formation of manganese nodules. They're going to set up a high-pressure tank in Bangor for experiments. Part of the student's job will be to analyze seafloor data and see how best to simulate those conditions in the tank.

"And Hank just got a new assistantship approved through the Bureau of Mines. You wanna tell them about it?"

Hank sat up. "Yeah. This'll be a mix of glaciology and economic geology. We'll build a computer model of ice movement and correlate it with some till samples I collected. The bottom line is we're using glacial deposits and flow directions to predict where to find ore deposits. It's going to take a lot of computer programming, and we might go out and do some augering and analyze more samples."

I can't say I entirely understood what they were talking about. I gathered that the first project would involve hiring someone to fly a plane over a large swath of wilderness and measure the Earth's magnetic field and gravitational field, both of which are influenced by mineral formations. After identifying some likely spots, they'd detonate explosives or to send out special trucks that stomp the ground, then study the way vibrations travel through the Earth's crust in an area where there might be metals. The second project was about manganese nodules, which are little lumps of minerals that form on the ocean floor. People have dreamed for a long time about dredging them up and extracting the minerals, but the more people learn about the organisms that live in the deep ocean, the more the idea seems like an environmental nightmare. Maybe this company wanted to grow their own nodules or just figure out where to find something better; I don't know. The third project revolved around a computer simulation and some dirt and rocks that were left behind by glaciers. "Augering," which sounds a bit like fortune-telling, just means drilling holes in the ground, sometimes by hand, and pulling dirt out. Till is the stuff that's left on the ground after glaciers melt.

This may surprise you, but I thought all three projects sounded intriguing. That's why I was here. I decided I'd be happy with any of them. I thought the manganese nodule project would be particularly exciting, because it might involve going on a ship. I had never seen the ocean, unless you count my brief glimpse of the harbor in New Hampshire.

I was a little surprised when Hank looked at me and said, "Ian, you do any programming?"

"Just as a hobby," I said. "I think it's fun, but I've never been a CS major or anything."

Tom smiled. "You wouldn't be here if you were a CS major. The important thing is to understand the processes. You can pick up the programming as you go along."

Kim spoke next. She had a heavy Chinese accent and onorthodox sentence structures. At that time, my experience with foreigners was limited to Spanish speakers, and I could barely follow what she was saying. The others, particularly the professors, seemed to have no trouble understanding Kim at all. I felt like a bit of a hayseed, and I was terrified to think that she might ask me a question and leave me dumbfounded.

From what I could gather, partly from what Kim said and partly from what the professors said in response, she had some programming experience and an extensive math background. Tom said that he could use her on the Ontario project, because it would involve a lot of geostatistics and other kinds of analysis that I had never heard of.

Abby said that she had taken some oceanography classes and would be interested in the manganese nodule project. The professors nodded happily, and then everyone looked at me.

"So," said Tom, "would you be interested in the glacial modeling project?"

"Sure," I said. I wasn't sure I was qualified for any of the projects, so it made little difference which one I took.

"Great!" Tom turned to Abby and Kim. "I'll be your advisor and committee chair. Ian, Hank will be your thesis advisor, and I'll be your academic advisor and committee chair. Ian and Kim should probably both get someone from the CS department to be on your committees, and Abby, you should have Elliot on your committee. He's a geochemist. Ian might want Elliot on his committee, too. But you guys don't have to come up with committees right away. You just need them by the end of your first year. Do you guys have any questions?"

The three of us looked at each other silently and shrugged. None of us knew enough about anything yet to ask a question.

"Great! You two can get together and talk about the glacial project, and I'll meet with you guys individually." He meant Hank and I would talk about glaciers, and he'd talk with Abby and Kim about their projects.

As we stood up, Hank asked me, "Are you free at two o'clock?"

"Um, yeah, I think so."

"Let's meet in my office. I'm in room 240 at the Bureau. It's in the Jackson Building."

"Okay, I'll see you then."

I really didn't know if I was free at two o'clock or not, and I had no idea where the Jackson Building was. I immediately went outside, sat down on the grass, and pulled the printout of my class schedule out of my backpack. I saw with relief that I would be free at two. Then I pulled out my student handbook and looked up the Jackson Building on a map of the campus.

Looking at the schedule reminded me that I still needed to buy textbooks. I stuffed the schedule back in my bag and trotted off to the SUB, where the bookstore was, hoping to buy the book for my eleven o'clock class before the class started. I decided I'd better buy some paper while I was at it, so I could take some more notes.

The Jackson Building was small but grand and made of granite. It was clearly from the nineteenth century, and it was clearly designed by an architect who thought that government buildings should look important. It was two stories tall and about the size of a New England farmhouse, which is to say bigger than most houses but smaller than most public buildings. It had a few wide, granite steps out front to remind entrants that this was a temple of minerology and bureaucracy. Inside, I went up a creaky stairway to a long, tall, and rather dark hallway full of antique wood paneling and doors with transoms on top.

I found Hank's door, which was not quite closed all the way. I knocked and gently pushed it open. Hank, who was sitting at his desk, said, "Ian! C'mon in."

Like the hallway, Hank's office had a high ceiling. It was kind of a small room, and I think its height was actually greater than its width. The odd proportions made the room feel like something the architect hadn't planned, unless the architect had intended for this to be a phone booth or a place to store skis. Behind Hank's desk was a window with an old-fashioned radiator under it, and against one wall was a big file cabinet, the wide kind in which the files hang perpendicular to the front. The other walls were all covered with floor-to-ceiling bookshelves.

Hank definitely had a lot of books, but not enough to fill such a vast amount of shelf space. The top shelves, which were too high to reach, were empty. Some other shelves held canvas bags that I assumed were full of rock samples. There were also some transparent acrylic tubes about four inches in diameter, some ring stands like chemists use, and a lot of hose fittings and stray bits of Teflon tape. I also noticed coils of copper tubing in various diameters and some automotive hoses and hose clamps.

I said hi and sat on a creaky office chair in front of Hank's desk. The desk was made of steel, with beige paint that had chipped off in places to reveal a layer of battleship grey. It might have been built for the military during World War II. On top of the desk were piles of stapled photocopies of articles from scientific journals. I also noticed several legal pads covered with dense writing and scribbled diagrams.

Hank asked, "So, how do you like your first day at Mines?"

"Oh, it seems okay so far. I had a couple classes today."

"You taking hydrogeochemistry with Neubaumer?"

"Yeah. It's pretty intense."

"I taught that one last year while she was on sabbatical. It's a good class."

"Oh, I didn't know you were into chemistry."

"I'm into lots of things. Gotta stay on top of things."

"Yeah, I guess so."

"So, you know much about glaciology?"

"Um, just what I've picked up in regular geology classes, mostly 101 and geomorphology. People don't talk much about glaciology in Arizona."

"You'll pick it up. For what you'll be doing, you'll need to know about a lot of things, and I don't expect you to know them already."

I smiled. "Good thing!"

"Do you know FORTRAN?" He was referring to a computer language.

"No, I've just used Visual Basic. I took a couple programming classes in high school, but it's just something I do for fun."

"Good! Fun is the way to go. You learn more. If you took a class just to get the grade and didn't think it was fun, then I'd worry. But if you really like it, you can learn as much as you need."

"Will I need to know FORTRAN?"

"Nah. FORTRAN is what everybody uses, but you don't have to."

"People still use FORTRAN? I thought it was a dead language."

"Just scientists and mathematicians. It's a tradition, like Latin. FORTRAN is supposed to be good for computation, but computers are so fast now it makes no never mind of shake. You could use LOGO and it wouldn't matter."

I didn't know what LOGO was, but I was too busy trying to figure out what "never mind of shake" meant to think about it.

Hank forged on. "You study object-oriented programming?"

"Uh-huh." I wasn't sure what object-oriented programming was, but I remembered that my teacher in high school had referred to Visual Basic as an object-oriented language. I figured I had probably learned it, even if I didn't know what it was.

"You should prob'ly go with C++, then. If you're comfortable with object-orienting programming, then you should use it. Don't let FORTRAN tie you down. But C++ is better than Visual Basic for modeling. It's a little more low-level than VB. Lets you get at the nuts and bolts a little better." I wasn't sure if "comfortable" was the right word, but I nodded anyway.

In the programming world, "low-level" languages are the hard-core ones -- i.e. the down and dirty languages -- and "high-level" languages are the fluffier ones that insulate you from the machine. All the programming languages that people normally use, including Visual Basic and C++, are high-level languages, but some are higher than others.

Hank said, "You should take Practicum in C++. It's a one-credit class for programmers to pick up the language. You can still sign up for it, but you should do it today or tomorrow. Don't worry about the prerequisites; Tom can sign off for you."

"Okay."

"I teach a glaciology class every other year, but not this year. You should go ahead and learn the material on your own." He got up from his desk, walked to one of the big bookshelves, and pulled out a thick textbook with full-color printing on the cover. "Here's the book. Use this one and save yourself some money. Won't be in the bookstore this year, anyway." He handed it to me and then went back to the shelf. "Take a look at this one, too. It's a little more advanced." He pulled out a smaller book with a simple, blue cover. It looked like one of those textbooks with small print runs and not much artwork, the kind you only see in upper-level classes. In other words, it was meant for a small group of glacier devotees who didn't need full-color printing or example questions.

"We'll talk about the details later," he said. "Just brush up on glaciology and programming for now."

"Okay," I said. I opened each book and glanced at a few pages.

"We should plan to meet two or three times a week. Why don't you come back on Thursday, and we can see how things are going?"

"Sure. Should I come at the same time?"

"That's fine. Don't be a stranger, though. Come by anytime. Just be sure we meet often and don't get sidetracked."

"Thanks."

"You have an office yet?"

"An office? No." I had never had an office in my life.

"Ask Evelyn if she can set you up with one. If not, we can squeeze you in here somewhere."

"Okay. Um, who's Evelyn?"

"Geoscience secretary. You probably talked to her but just didn't know her name."

"Oh, right." I had actually just forgotten her name.

The meeting seemed to be winding down, so I opened my bag and put the books in it. "Thanks for the books," I said. "I'll try to read them before I get too bogged down with classes."

"Don't worry yourself too much about classes. Your thesis is the important thing."

"Hmm." I nodded, wondering if I was supposed to take his comment seriously.

When I stood up and turned around, I noticed a contraption on one of the shelves. It was a transparent cylinder with an aluminum piston inside it. The piston had three black O-rings to help seal it. The cylinder was mounted vertically on a stand, and the piston had a pushrod that stuck out the top of the cylinder. A thick, aluminum disk covered the bottom end of the cylinder. A piece of black automotive hose was attached to a fitting on the bottom of the disk. The apparatus was definitely one-of-a-kind, probably fabricated on campus.

"What's that?" I asked.

"Something that didn't work. I'm studying the behavior if ice under pressure, and that's a pressure vessel. Works fine at room temperature, but when you freeze it, the materials shrink at different rates, and the piston binds in the cylinder. I tried making a new piston out of acrylic, but it's damned hard to machine the stuff accurately. It's always heating and expanding as you work it. I'm exploring some other options now."

I was curious about what the other options might be, but he didn't seem inclined to discuss it. I thanked him and left.
