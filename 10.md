# Chapter 10

A few days after my terrifying dogsled experience, I had the dream again.

In the dream, I was in a desert somewhere in Arizona. There was an old building, a gas station made of concrete block. The paint was faded and peeling from decades of sunlight, and I saw an old Dumpster and random bits of garbage.

I walked around the building and found a dusty back yard. There was no fence or anything to define the yard; it was just part of the desert. I saw a kid playing with Tonka trucks in the dry dirt, and I wanted to play with him. Evidently, I was a child, too.

The kid looked at me, and I realized he wasn't a human child after all. He was a monster. He glared at me and stood up. I wanted to run away, but at the same time I felt like I couldn't leave something that horrible alive. It was like if you found a rattlesnake in your house -- you wouldn't just leave it there. And I was afraid to run away, because I didn't want to turn my back on this thing.

I decided to attack the monster, even though I knew I didn't have a very good chance of winning. I snarled and ran toward it, punching as I approached. It grabbed me and pulled me down, and suddenly we were wrestling, and the monster was suffocating me. I reached behind me and clawed at the monster's face.

My parents appeared from around the building. My father was angry at me. He didn't understand what was happening, because he thought the monster was a human. My mother could tell that he was really a monster, though, and she came running and snarling. By the time she reached us, she had transformed into one of those hideous Grosvenor dogs. I wasn't afraid of her, though. I knew she was going to save me.

My mother, in her scary dog form, grabbed the monster by the neck and pulled it off me. Then my father ran over and told her to stop. She dropped the monster, who turned into a pathetic-looking kid, and then she turned back into herself.

Another person appeared. It was an adult that I could tell was really a monster in disguise. He yelled at us, and my parents and I ran away. We ran toward a big highway where there were big trucks going by, because we knew we'd be safe there. Then I woke up.

It was still dark, but there was no way I could go back to sleep. I kept going back over the dream, trying to remember all the details. It seemed like there was something important about it. There was something I needed to remember.

I got up and walked to the kitchen in the dark. As always, the plastic in the hallway crinkled under my feet. I opened the fridge, and the light was blinding. I was tempted to try one of Kieffer's cans of lime pop, but I couldn't imagine where I'd find a new one to replace it. Eleanore had some sparkling springwater in there, so I took one. I went to the living room and flopped into the dentist chair.

My dreams are always pretty random, but this one was different. In fact, it seemed less random than usual. It seemed like the dream was supposed to happen that way. I wondered if it was a recurring dream that I had never remembered before.

I heard Eleanore's alarm clock beep. There was still no light out -- the sun rises pretty late in Maine in the winter. The hall light came on, and I heard Eleanore's crinkly footsteps go to the bathroom. A few minutes later, she walked into the kitchen and turned the light on.

The kitchen and living room were only separated by a bar, so they were sort of the same room. When Eleanore turned the light on, I squinted, held my hand up to shield my eyes, and said hi.

Eleanore jumped and peered wide-eyed into the dark living room. I had scared the bejeezus out of her. "Ian?" she asked tentatively.

"Yeah. Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you."

"Jesus Christ! What are you doing?"

"Oh, I had a weird dream, and I couldn't sleep."

"So you're sitting in the living room in the dark? Why don't you turn some lights on?"

I shrugged. "It's still dark out."

Eleanore scowled. "There's something wrong with your logic, but I'm not sure what it is right now."

"Hmm."

She put a pitcher of crimson-colored juice and a jug of milk on the bar. "I didn't know you liked that stuff," she said.

"What stuff?"

"Sparkling Poland Spring." She pointed at the bottle in my hand.

I had forgotten I had it. In fact, I hadn't even opened it. I felt like an idiot. "Oh, yeah. Um, I haven't tried it yet."

As she poured breakfast cereal into a bowl, she asked, "Were you steeling yourself for it? Gathering the nerve?"

I laughed and probably blushed. "No, I was just spacing out. I'm just thinking about the dream I had."

With a bowl of cereal in one hand and a glass of juice in the other, Eleanore walked around the bar and turned on the living room light. "How do you keep from running into things?" she asked. "I'd break my nose if I tried to walk around in the dark."

I shrugged again. "I know where everything is. I run into unexpected things, like puppets, but I know where all the furniture and the walls are."

She sat down at the bowling table. "It's still kinda weird. I mean, I know where things are in an academic sense, but I still have to see where I'm going. You should use a cane or something."

I laughed and opened my bottle.

After she had swallowed a few bites of cereal, she asked, "What was your dream about?"

"I was a little kid, and I was fighting a monster that was disguised as a little kid, and then my mom turned into one of those Grosvenor dogs and saved me. Remember that dog in Grosvenor?"

"You mean the terrifying mutant dog? Yeah, I remember."

"When Kieffer and I went dogsledding, we saw a whole team of them, and Jesus, they were scary that time. But when my mom turned into one in the dream, I wasn't scared of her at all. She fought off the monster."

"Sounds trippy."

"Yeah. I think I've actually had that dream before. The gas station in Grosvenor reminded me of it. But the really weird thing is that it seems like it's not just a dream."

"It doesn't exactly sound like reality."

"No, but I mean, I think it's something that happened in real life when I was a kid."

I sniffed the sparkling water, which didn't smell like anything, and then I tried it. I had never had sparkling water before, and it was quite unlike anything I had tasted. It wasn't bad, though.

Eleanore looked at me skeptically. "You mean you fought a monster in real life, or your mother metamorphosed into a dog?"

"Well, I mean, it didn't literally happen, but I think maybe something weird happened with my mother. She died when I was ten, so it would have to be a long time ago."

"Maybe she saved you from a bully."

"Yeah, I think it's something like that. But that must have been one badass bully." I grasped for memories of the dream and the even more evasive memories of real life. I said mistily, "I think it was at a gas station in the desert."

"Is your father still around?"

"Yeah, I should ask him about it. I need to call him, anyway."

That evening, I called my father. I asked him to scrounge under my bed for plans of my grandfather's mine. I told him I was writing a report on the mine for a class, because I didn't want to explain that I had a gnomish professor who knew my dead grandparents and asked goofy questions. None of my classes actually involved writing reports, but my father didn't know that.

After I had asked my father to send me whatever he could find, I said, "This might sound kind of weird, but when I was little, did I ever get into a fight behind a gas station?"

He laughed loudly. "You remember that? I thought you were too young to remember."

"Sort of. I wasn't sure if it really happened or not."

"Yeah, that was when we went on that big road trip up north. You remember we went to see Yellowstone and Mount Rushmore?"

"I just remember a few random parts."

"That was... Oh, I don't know, around Holbrook or Gallup or someplace. I was pumping gas, and you and your mom went to the bathroom. It was one of those places where the bathroom is around the side of the building. Somehow you wandered out back and found that kid, and just like that you guys were fighting. His father owned the gas station, and he went apeshit."

"What did Mom do?"

"She flipped. I thought she was gonna kill that kid. You know how she was with Indians anyway."

"What do you mean? How was she with Indians?"

"Didn't you know that? She was kind of a racist. I was always giving her shit about it."

"Mom was a racist? Are you serious?"

"Well, she always said she wasn't. You were kind of a little racist yourself. I mean, it didn't take any time at all for you to pick a fight with that Indian kid at the gas station."

"But..." I was momentarily speechless. "I had lots of Native American friends. You remember Joey? He was a Yavapai. He was my best friend in elementary school."

"Yeah. Your mom always said she liked some tribes better than others. She said she didn't hate all Indians; she just didn't like Hopis. I thought that was malarky, 'cause I didn't think she could tell a Hopi from a Navajo from a freakin' Eskimo."

Navajos and Innuits, or Eskimos if you prefer, are actually related, but I didn't feel like explaining it. His cultural ignorance made the whole situation even more surreal.

"Are you saying I attacked that kid because he was a Hopi and I was a little skinhead?"

"Something like that. Nobody saw how it started, so I don't know who attacked who. You probably both attacked each other. Maybe he was a racist, too. His father didn't seem to like us any more than you and your mom liked them."

"There must have been more to it than that. I didn't just go around attacking kids all the time."

"No, it was just that once."

"I mean even once! I wouldn't just... I can't even identify Hopis myself. How could I have hated Hopis if I didn't even know what they looked like?"

"I don't know. Maybe you just didn't like that kid. Maybe he wasn't even a Hopi."

"So, what, did Mom and the gas station owner have it out after the kid and I fought?"

"Pretty much. I mean, seeing your kid in a fight doesn't make you very happy, but it was more than that. They both went apeshit. I think your mom and that guy hated each other on sight. Maybe he could tell she was a racist."

"Would you stop saying that?"

"Stop what?"

"You keep calling Mom a racist!"

"Well, okay, she was insensitive to Hopis."

"That's much better. What about Grams and Grampie? Were they like that, too?"

"Charles, your grampie, he was a regular guy. Your grams was like your mom, though. I'm sure that's where she got it. She always hated Arizona, and I think they just represented the state for her."

"So I got into a fight because my grandmother didn't like the desert?"

"Well, yeah, indirectly."

"Did Grandma really not like Arizona?"

"Are you kidding? She hated living here. She always said it was killing her. I guess she didn't like the heat. Didn't you know that?"

"I guess I kind of remember that, because I remember taking it literally. I thought it was really scary."

"Yeah, well, she probably meant it literally."

"So why did she live there? Why didn't she and Grampie just go back to Maine?"

"She wanted to be with you and your mom, and Grampie had his job at the mine. Then, when Grampie died, she just couldn't take it anymore. And her sister, your Great Aunt Margaret, got sick back in Maine. That was when she finally moved. But I guess you know she didn't last long after she got back."

"Yeah. She died before Mom, right?"

"Yeah, let's see... Grampie died when you were about five, and Grams left soon after that, and then she died a couple years later, so you must have been about seven. I'm surprised you can remember her."

"I mostly just remember her singing and telling stories."

He laughed. "She only did that around you. With me, she just acted miserable all the time."

"Did she babysit a lot? For me, I mean?"

"At times she did. Remember the summer when your mom was on dialysis?"

"Sort of. I remember going to the hospital a lot, and I remember Grams and Grampie taking me to stay at their house. I thought it was a lot of fun, but I knew Mom was sick. Grams thought Arizona was making Mom sick."

"Yeah, I remember that. She said that a lot."

"Why didn't we just all move to Maine, if everybody was so unhappy?"

"We weren't all unhappy; it was just Grams. Your mom hated Maine as much as Grams hated Arizona, so one of them had to be miserable. And moving to Maine wouldn't have cured your mom's diabetes, anyway. It was better for her to stick here with the same doctors."

"What about Grampie? Did he care where he lived?"

"He just wanted to stay at the mine, I think. He didn't care what state he was in, but he loved that mine."

"Did that make Grams jealous?"

"I think she admired him for it. It was his duty, the whole World War II thing. He came back from the war, he came out here for the mine, and then it was like the mine was his country. It's too bad they shut it down as soon as he died. He must have been the only thing keeping that mine alive."
