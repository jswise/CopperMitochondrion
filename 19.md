# Chapter 19

The conference was the high point of my scientific career and the end of it.  I may have succeeded in destroying my advisor's career, too.

In his incompetent way, Hank had been right.  There really was copper in Grosvenor, but it didn't get into his sample through any process he could have imagined.

After Angeline told the stories of our ancestors, Frances took me to the lowest part of the cave.  The passage, like others in Tloknoskets, had been enlarged to accomodate humans.  Unlike the other passages, this one led down to a flooded section.  The well-worn floor descended into perfectly still and clear water, like a subterranean boat ramp.

Frances explained that this section hadn't always been flooded.  During the last glacial advance, the ice flowing through the nearby valley had bisected the cave.  Water from the cave had drained into a subglacial tunnel, a tributary to the glacier's own stream of meltwater.

The ice tunnel was the Kayhotul burial ground.  The ice, the stream, and the sediments under the stream were always changing.  Our ancestors left their dead to be consumed by the glacier and carried slowly to the ocean.  I don't mean to be disrespectful, but I imagine their frozen remains underwent a certain amount of grinding and smearing along the way.  When the glacier retreated, the ancestors who hadn't made it to the ocean were just organic matter in the till, which got reworked as outwash.  Whatever copper they had on them could have survived, at least in small pieces.  Hank had, without realizing it, robbed the graves of our ancestors.

If Hank had known that his copper had a human origin, it would have been an earth-shaking archaeological find. But it wasn't recognizable as anthropogenic, and everybody knew there were no humans in North America before the glaciers retreated.

After assuming the copper had a natural origin, Hank had contorted himself to explain how it got there.  He mistook his assumption for a fact.  He started with a conclusion and tried to prove it, rather than starting with a hypothesis and testing it.  It was bad science.

If Hank had been a better scientist, he would have tested what he knew.  He knew he had found copper in glacial sediment in Grosvenor.  How did he know the sediment was that old?  How did he knew the copper had been laid down with the sediment and not buried by humans later?  If the copper was carried by ice, how did he know it had a local origin and didn't come from hundreds of miles away?  His big contribution to science could have been just establishing that the copper had been in a glacier, leaving the question of its origin to further research.

Luckily for the Kayhotul, Hank was not a good scientist.  Good science leads to questions.  It could have lead outsiders to discover the real copper deposits in Grosvenor.  The Kayhotul would risk being discovered ourselves or letting Tloknoskets be replaced by a strip mine.  Our survival as a tribe depends on secrecy and the unifying power of Tloknoskets.  Without the cave to hold us together, we would disperse like the Monster Slayers and forget who we are.

To prevent questions, I had to discredit Hank's work.  He and I needed to look so nutty that people would overlook or disbelieve what he had actually found.  Ideally, any future speculation about copper in Grosvenor would remind people of our crackpot theory.

The glacial flow model, the subject of my thesis, wasn't really research.  It was an illustration to prove what Hank thought he already knew.  It was based on circular logic, building the conclusion into the assumptions, and it didn't really prove anything.  It demonstrated that we didn't know what we were doing.  All I had to do was present it earnestly.  If people asked penetrating questions, I would repeat myself and pretend that I didn't understand what they were asking.

I finished my presentation, and the audience clapped politely.  The moderator asked if there were any questions.  That was when I knew I had succeeded.  Nobody had any questions, and I was sure they thought I was so clueless that there was no point.  To break the silence, the moderator asked a question about an unimportant detail.  I answered, and we all waited through a little more silence.  Then the moderator thanked me, they clapped again, and my career was over.

I didn't know what the hell I was going to do with my life, but I had saved Tloknoskets.
