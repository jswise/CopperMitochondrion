# Chapter 1

> *If time travelers from today were to visit North America in the late Pleistocene, they would see in the forests and plains an impossible bestiary of lumbering mastodon, armored rhinos, great dire wolves, sabertooth cats, and ten-foot-long gyptodonts lilke enormous armadillos.  Beavers the size of armchairs; turtles that weighed almost as much as cars; sloths able to reach tree branches twenty feet high; huge, flightless, predatory birds like rapacious ostriches -- the tally of Pleistocene monsters is long and alluring.*

I was terrified, but not for the reasons you would think.

I was at a conference center in Massachusetts.  I loaded two bland pastries and a mini croissant onto a small plate.  I wandered through a crowd of chatting scientists, avoiding the tables where people were sitting down and introducing themselves to each other.  I paused in front of a large poster about somebody's research, gazing as if I were reading it.  I didn't want to meet anybody or talk to anybody.  I was getting ready play a role, and I wasn't in character yet.

I was a graduate student, and I was about to give a presentation in front of real scientists.  This was my debut in the scientific community.  But I wasn't worried about impressing them.

What terrified me was the possibility that they would take me seriously.  I needed to convince them that I was a crackpot.

I turned away from the poster and looked around the room.  All these people are more or less cousins, I thought.  Their genes are almost identical.  They're all descendants of a small group, a few thousand people, who barely survived extinction somewhere in Africa.  Most have a bit of Neandertal DNA -- especially the redheads -- and perhaps a bit of Denisovan.  They all got their mitochondria from a woman who lived about 150,000 years ago.

I felt like I was at somebody else's family reunion.  I was only partly from their gene pool.  A quarter of my ancestors were from a different tribe.  My mitochondria came from a different grandmother, one they'd never heard of.  If I wanted them to think I was a crackpot, I could just tell them I'm from an unknown mitochondrial haplogroup.  These people were geologists, not genetecists, but they would quickly figure out that it was crazy talk.

That wasn't the kind of crazy I was aiming for.  I needed them to think I was a bad geologist, not a deranged eugenecist.  I needed to show them that my thesis research was full of holes.  My people -- the people I didn't know were mine, didn't know existed, until recently -- depended on it.

When I was little, I thought miners used slide rules.  I was kind of an odd kid.

My grandfather was a mining engineer.  Some eastern investors sent him out west to run their copper mine, and that's how I came to be born in Arizona.  He died when I was pretty young, and he left me two things:  his slide rule and his Maine School of Mines pennant.  He evidently had some ideas about my future.

My mother ended up with all my grandfather's papers, and she took a while to get around to throwing them away.  While the papers were sitting in boxes in our garage, I acquired a random collection of engineering drawings, maps of the mine, and account books.  While other kids were playing video games, I would look at my grandfather's maps and imagine that I was walking around in the mine.  I begged my parents to take me to the real  mine, but they said the owners had closed the mine after my grandfather died, and it was too far to drive anyway.

Sometimes I'd convince my friends to play miner, which always involved getting out the slide rule to calculate how much TNT to use or how long the fuse needed to be.  Then I'd get out the account books and start ordering more TNT and fuses, at which point my friends invariably got bored and went off to play video games.

My mother was horrified by my obsession with mining.  She had little in common with her father, and she had nothing at all to do with mines.  She told me that mines were dark, cold, dangerous, and dirty, which in my view made them quite appealing.  They had all the allure of a jungle or a pirate-infested island, with air conditioning as a bonus.  She also told me that my grandfather's lungs went bad because of mining, but I knew it was really because he smoked like a chimney.

My mother died when I was ten, and my father took a calmer view of my career ambitions.  He knew almost nothing about mining, but he did know that my grandfather wasn't exactly a miner, as he was pretty sure that miners didn't use slide rules in real life.  He suggested that if I went to college and studied rocks or math or something, as my grandfather had done, then I might get to be one of the important guys who have offices and get to go anywhere they want in the mine and draw maps, rather than just drilling and blasting all day.  I thought it sounded like a good plan, and that's pretty much how I ended up going to the University of Arizona and studying geology.

When I finished there, I wanted to keep going.  I wasn't one of the slide rule guys yet.  Actually, nobody uses slide rules anymore, and to this day I don't know how to use one.  At any rate, I needed an advanced degree, so I applied to my grandfather's alma mater.  I could have stayed where I was, but going to Maine seemed like more fun.

I applied to the master's program in economic geology.  Economic geologists are the people who tell mining engineers like my grandfather where they're likely to find ore.  Mining engineers then decide which way the miners should dig and how to keep the mine from collapsing while they're doing it.  Geologists get to do less math and more hand-waving than engineers, and nobody blames the geologists if a mine collapses.

While I was between schools, I worked as a tour guide in an old copper mine in one of the most barren parts of Arizona.  It was one of those places that manage to make money off the fact that they're in the middle of nowhere.  Families on the long drive from Carlsbad Caverns to the Grand Canyon would pass a sign in the desert that read, "See the world famous Broken Pick Mine!  68 miles ahead."  Then there'd be one that read, "Go 800 feet underground at the Broken Pick Mine!  49 miles ahead."  The signs were mainly designed to electrify children and make them start whining at their parents.  This was in 1995, when kids still looked out the window, because they had no screens to look at in the car.  Next, there'd be a sign to get Mom's attention:  "See our collection of over 400 cute figurines!"  It was important to provide an alternate activity that had nothing to do with mining, since the prospect of going eight hundred feet underground is more terrifying than entertaining for many people.  After about seven of these button-pushing billboards came the clincher, the final argument that allowed no rebuttal:  "It's 57 all year in the Broken Pick Mine!  Next right!"

You probably don't attach any significance to the temperature fifty-seven degrees Fahrenheit.  To understand its importance, you really need to spend a day driving across Arizona in a minivan full of kids.  The roads get so hot in Arizona that they'll cook the bottom of your car with infrared radiation.  If a Hershey bar falls on the floor, it'll melt completely in thirty seconds.  The rest of the car, particularly the back seat where the loudest children are, isn't much cooler.  Now, tell me you wouldn't stop for fifty-seven degrees Fahrenheit.

I have to say that it was a real mine, not just a tourist trap.  Aside from the rubber tomahawk shop and the collection of cute figurines, it was actually a pretty educational experience.  The owner was a lot more conscientious than you would have guessed from his billboards, and he made sure that the employees were all well-versed in mining history.  Hopefully, some of those kids – and possibly even their parents – left there with a little appreciation for geology and history.

The tour always started with everybody picking out hardhats.  A curious thing I discovered is that everybody thinks they have a big head -- I guess it's an ego thing.  Men especially would go straight for the biggest hardhats, try them on, then crank the adjustment straps down to fit their ordinary heads.  In my tour guide voice, which is the loudest I can talk while still sounding friendly and comforting, I would say, "A good way to make sure your hardhat fits is to look straight up, like this."  I would look at the sky, the guests would do the same, and I would hear the sound of several hardhats clattering to the ground, followed by suppressed giggles all around.

There was a secret about the hardhats that we never revealed to the tourists.  The hardhats were actually all the same size, but they were just different colors.  If you picked up one of the "big" hardhats and then cranked the strap down to make it smaller, it would be the same as wearing a "small" hardhat.  At the end of the day, we'd crank the straps back up to make them big again.

While everybody was adjusting their hardhats, I'd have to check for babies in backpacks.  At least once per day, someone would put on a hardhat while carrying a baby in a backpack, overlooking the fact that the baby was much less durable than their own head.  Sometimes, the spouse would make a brief attempt to stick a hardhat on the baby and then give up.  Others just didn't think twice about it.  When I explained to them that they would need to get rid of the packs and carry the babies in their arms, most of them complied and felt a little silly for overlooking it.  Some, however, would balk.  "I'll just duck for the low spots," they'd say, oblivious to the fact that bending over would actually make the baby more vulnerable.  Then I would be in one of those awkward positions where I'd have to be as nice as possible while forcing someone to obey my will.  After all, I couldn't just let them learn the hard way.

There was a good reason for wearing hardhats, by the way.  It's not like a construction site, where people walk around with hardhats on just in case a stray two by four comes their way.  Whenever I led a group through the mine, we were accompanied by a periodic "THOCK!" sound as the guests discovered the true purpose of hardhats.  The miners who dug the place weren't very tall by modern standards, and they didn't make the mine any taller than they had to.

My own hardhat never got a scratch, not because of any particular skill on my part but because I happen to be even shorter than the bygone miners.  My coworkers sometimes made Snow White jokes in reference to my height.  I'm also as bald and as pale as a cue ball, so they liked to make jokes about my "white hardhat."

I come from a long line of short, round, bald people on my maternal grandmother's side.  They were Mainers who were descendants of voyageurs, the French Canadian fur traders who paddled cargo canoes and carried ninety pounds of beaver pelts on their backs.  It's good to know that my odd physique is good for something.

The most amusing part of the job was answering questions.  They ranged from "What year did they start using pneumatic tools?" to "Where's a good place to go mountain biking?"  A lot of the questions came from kids, who are much less timid than adults.

Once, I got a question from a kid who wasn't old enough to talk.  She raised her hand, I called on her, and she went into one of those experimental monologues that babies try out when they know how to make syllables but not words.  I nodded and enthusiastically said, "Uh-huh!"  She seemed happy with my answer.

There's one question that I know a lot of adults were afraid to ask, and they were relieved when children asked the question for them.  This question would often be prefaced by a woman muttering to her kid, "Go ahead – ask him!"  Then the kid would say, "Um… uh… Where did the miners go to the bathroom?"  The answer is that they used litter boxes, which were dynamite crates with sand in them.  And the little stream that runs alongside the track in the mine is called the "piss ditch," though I usually didn't mention that.

Another common question, this one from adults, was, "What did the miners do for fun?"  The answer, which I would try to phrase delicately, was that they drank and went to whorehouses.  Miners made plenty of money, and many of them had come from Europe alone.  They also had a practical reason for drinking, because frequent exposure to nitroglycerin fumes causes nasty withdrawal headaches, much like caffeine addiction.

Sometimes, there'd be some questions about the Lost Dutchman Mine, which is a sort of modern El Dorado.  There's a legend about a guy who, back in the nineteenth century, got lost in the Superstition Mountains in Arizona and found the mother lode.  Upon returning to civilization, he showed people some gold that he'd found and then, to make the story more interesting, he died.  Ever since then, people have been trying to find that mine.  Some searchers have died out there – after all, there's a reason the Dutchman got lost in the first place.  Some people have even been murdered over it, and some others have sold fraudulent maps of it.  Meanwhile, there's evidence to suggest that somebody made up the whole story just to explain the origin of some gold that was, in reality, stolen.  In fact, many miners stole gold from their employers, a practice called "high grading," and then staked claims and worked bogus deposits in order to launder their gold.  But regardless of such rational considerations, many people are still looking for the Lost Dutchman,  proving that aspirations are much more powerful than facts.

The big question at the Broken Pick Mine, the one I dreaded, the one that got to the root of the whole existence of the mine, was this:  "How did the copper get here?"  I know, you're probably thinking that it's a perfectly reasonable question, one that you've often wondered about yourself.  But let me describe what typically happened when someone asked The Question.  First, I'd explain how a large mass of magma, which geologists call a pluton, gurgled up into the Earth's crust from below.  At this point, it would become clear to the whole group that the answer was going to be long, and generally the person who asked the question would start looking around and pretending that this was all for someone else's benefit.  Then I'd explain how the magma contained water and many other chemicals, all in very small concentrations, and the water dissolved some of the stuff in the magma and carried it out into the surrounding rock, which was being heated, broken, and deformed by the intrusion.  That's when the person who asked The Question would roll his eyes and start wondering if he should change the baby's diaper while he was waiting for me to finish.  But one or two other people would be interested – they were the ones who had been thinking, "I'd like to know where all this copper came from, but I know the answer would be really complicated and boring for everybody else, so I'll just look it up in the library when I get home."  For their benefit – and to punish the guy who asked the question – I would continue, explaining how the hot, mineral-laden water flowed through cracks in the rock and about the gradual changes in chemistry that caused certain minerals, such as copper sulfide, to come out of solution in a particular place.  Then I'd sum up by saying that the process that produced this ore body is essentially a process of taking something that was once widely dispersed and concentrating it.

If people were particularly curious or particularly annoying, I might provide an epilogue about the million dollar log.  This was a log that got buried in sediment and turned into what chemists call a reducing environment, while the sand around it wasn't doing anything interesting.  As water passed through the log, the abrupt change in chemistry caused uranium to come out of solution.  In other words, the log turned into petrified wood, and this particular piece of petrified wood was made of uranium ore.  When it was found in Utah during the uranium rush of the twentieth century, the log was worth a million dollars.  By the time I'd explained all that, the person who asked the question had typically wandered off to the bathroom and left the really interested ones to continue the tour.

Another reason that I gave such a long answer is that I think it's a fascinating subject.  After all, the question of how the ore got here is the second most important question in the mind of an economic geologist, the most important question being "Where can I find some more?"

Both are questions that people have asked for millennia, and they're questions with many answers.  Though I didn't burden my listeners with this knowledge, there are actually many ways that an ore body might form.  Some of the processes aren't yet understood, and undoubtedly some of them haven't even been discovered.  The city of Leadville, Colorado, where Horace and Baby Doe Tabor got so rich that they went around building opera houses and post offices as a hobby, began when someone found lead and silver in limestone.  According to any geologist of the time, this was impossible.  It was so far outside the pale of science that only someone who didn't know shit about geology could have found it.

Whenever I told people that I was going to Maine School of Mines, they thought I was out of my gourd.  One reason for this is that hardly anyone has ever heard of the school, and some people suspected that I was being willfully random.  You see, MSM is the academic equivalent of a one-hit wonder.  They have all kinds of departments, but most of them are no better than any cheesy state school that only local kids attend.  But any geologist or engineer in the mining field knows that MSM is one of the preeminent schools in its special field.  On the other hand, anyone who isn't a geologist, a mining engineer, or a Mainer – approximately ninety-eight percent of the United States – has never heard the name.  And to anyone who has spent their life in Arizona, the thought of spending a winter in Maine is terrifying.  In fact, even people who had lived there got a dark look of pity in their eyes, as if I'd just announced that I was going over Niagara Falls in a barrel.  It was a look that said, "You just don't know what it's like out there."

A lot of the guests at the mine – "guest" was our euphemism for "tourist" – took an interest in my education.  Old ladies especially would ask if I was a student at the University of Arizona, and I would say, "I was, but I'm starting at Maine School of Mines in the fall."  Then the ladies would say, "Ooh, that's a long way from home!"  Frequently, the husband would then say, "Goin' to Gabbro Falls, huh?  Boy, they got a good hockey team.  Helga and I spent forty-seven years in Rangeley.  Some years, it was forty below for months straight.  We just go up in the summers now, you know.  We got a place in Bullhead City where we spend the winters.  Boy…"  Then he'd get that look.  "I'm too old for those winters now."  Then the lady would change the subject, as if we were talking about death.  "Mines is a nice school.  Our daughter went there – she's a teacher in Waldoboro now."

I noticed that once I told people I was going to school in Maine, they assumed that I was already an expert on Maine geography.  I didn't have the faintest idea where Rangeley and Waldoboro were.  I  wasn't even sure where to find Gabbro Falls, my future home.

* * *

Before I started graduate school, I had never been farther east than New Mexico, except once when I went on a high school field trip to D.C.  People thought it was peculiar that I would enroll in a school without visiting it first, especially one in such an odd place.  But I knew of the school's reputation in the field, and I didn't really care where it was or what it looked like.

When I left Arizona on my way to Gabbro Falls, my father was terrified.  I hadn't arranged for a place to live, and he had morbid fantasies about me sleeping under a bridge and having my throat slit in the night.  He was also justifiably worried about my car, which had a high probability of breaking down in the middle of Nebraska, and about my aversion to stopping at motels.  I just can't bring myself to spend a hundred dollars on a place to sleep, knowing that I'll sleep just as well on the ground or in the driver's seat of my car.  And I'd just as soon keep driving if I can, so I can get to where I'm going and get on with the business of sleeping under bridges and having my throat cut.

I should also mention the huge cloud of uncertainty that surrounded the school at this point.  You see, I didn't even know if I was accepted until the middle of July, due to the behavior of a certain former professor of mine.  The most difficult part of getting into graduate school isn't taking the GRE or making a good impression; it's getting your old professors to write letters of recommendation.  The school you're applying to won't even look at your application until it's complete, which means it has to have GRE scores and three letters of recommendation attached to it.  If one of your old professors is a procrastinator, you're screwed.  Even a bad letter is better than an unwritten letter.

When the school finally got all my letters and scores, they sent me a very nice letter to congratulate me on my successful admission to the master's program.  The letter neglected to mention whether or not I had an assistantship, and more importantly, it didn't say when school started.  I checked the school's entire website, which was only a few pages back then.  It didn't include a schedule.  I waited a couple weeks for another letter to arrive, worrying that perhaps I was already too late.  Then I called the admissions office.

The woman who answered the phone sounded like the nicest Maine grandmother you've ever met.  I'll bet she was from Rangeley.

"Hi," I said, "I'm starting in the graduate program in the fall.  I got a letter of acceptance, but it didn't say when I should be there.  Can you tell me when orientation is?"

"Oh, I'm sorry.  How about if you just come by the office, and we can give you the packet for grad students?"

I thought this was a shockingly odd thing for her to say.  I know now that virtually all of the undergraduates at MSM live in Maine, so from her perspective it didn't seem strange at all.  In any case, I didn't want to piss off the admissions lady before I even arrived, so I had to think of something nice to say that would get her to answer my question.  "Um… Well, I'm actually in Arizona."

"Oh, my!  Well, you can just come by whenever you get to Gabbro Falls.  When are you thinking of coming?"

I breathed deeply.  "I don't know.  When's orientation?"

"Oh, orientation starts the day after Labor Day, at ten o'clock."

"Great!  I'll see you then."

"Yup!  See ya then."

Next, I called the geoscience office.  This time, I needed to be even more delicate.

"Um, my name is Ian Dawson, and I'm a new graduate student."

The secretary sounded like an old friend.  "Oh, hi!  It's good to hear from you.  Are you excited about coming to Mines?"

"Oh, sure.  But, um, I was wondering if there's a way to find out whether or not I have an assistantship."

An assistantship, in case you're wondering, is sort of a special job for graduate students.  It basically means that you get paid to go to school, as long as you teach some lab classes or work on some kind of research.  It means the difference between focusing on school full time and deliving pizzas.  So MSM was not only my school but also a potential employer, which made me very nervous.

"Let's see," said the secretary.  "You were the one with the missing letter, right?"

"Uh, yeah."

"Yeah, you haven't been assigned an assistantship."  She sounded sympathetic, and she immediately tried to cheer me up.  "I'm sure you'll get one, though.  There are three students without assistantships, and there are two assistantships that just came up.  And there's a third one that they're just about to finalize.  So at least two of you will get assistantships, and probably all three.  So I wouldn't worry about it."

"Ah.  Well, thanks, and… I'll see you soon."  I felt odd saying that to someone I'd never met.

"Great!  Bye-bye now."

* * *

To get back to what I was saying, I left Arizona knowing approximately where Gabbro Falls was and knowing that I probably, but not definitely, had an assistantship.  I knew when orientation started, but I didn't know where I was going to live.  I didn't even know where orientation would be.  I could find out if I stopped by the admissions office, but I didn't know where that was, either.

I had all my possessions in an old Toyota Tercel.  This wasn't a modern, yuppie Toyota, but one from back when Japanese cars were cheap and rugged -- good proletarian cars.  Those cars were the Model T of the '80s.  Mine was pushing two hundred thousand miles, and it burned oil at a rate of one quart for each tank of gas.  It also had paint that had faded to a sort of neutral brown, a color that was at once unique and inconspicuous.  It would have made a good getaway car for committing crimes, because no one would remember seeing it.  The only noticeable thing about it was that I had optimistically strapped my snowboard to the roof, even though I wasn't sure if Maine had mountains.

The drive was so long that I got into that sort of timeless state where you don't care what time of day it is.  I drove, slept in a rest stop for two or three hours, and drove again.  I stopped at truck stops in the middle of the night and couldn't figure out if I should be eating dinner or breakfast.  I followed the efficiently mind-numbing freeways, which sort of channeled me toward my destination.  I just had one brief interruption when I got turned around in Denver and accidentally headed west on I-70.  A nice thing about getting lost in Denver is that if you see fourteen-thousand foot mountains in front of you, you know in an instant that you're not headed toward the Great Plains.

After thousands of miles and several days of delirium, I got my first glimpse of saltwater.  At Portsmouth, New Hampshire, I-95 went over a grand bridge with six lanes of traffic.  Stainless steel letters announced that I was crossing a river whose name I couldn't hope to pronounce or remember.  Far below the bridge, in dim, evening light, I could see real ships loading and unloading cargo.  The unpronounceable river was a harbor, an estuary, a little arm of the Atlantic Ocean.

At the other end of the bridge was Maine.  I saw some welcoming signs and a giant lobster painted on some kind of industrial tank.  Right away, the freeway headed through endless forest, the exits got sparse, and I was surrounded by cars with Massachussetts plates.  This was Vacationland.

Sometime that night, I finally arrived in Gabbro Falls.  The university was easy to find, since it was the biggest thing in town.  I parked in the first parking lot I saw and went to sleep.
