# Chapter 18

In the early days, Tekpatac, the Fire Mother, and Tnekpatlah, the Stone Father, lived alone in a universe of fog.  Everything was grey, and they couldn't tell one place from another, and there was nothing for them to talk about except the fog and themselves.  They got tired of talking about fog, and then they got tired of talking about themselves, and then they argued, and then they didn't talk at all.

Finally, when Fire Mother was tired of silence, she burned the fog just to see what would happen.  The fog turned into air.  Then Stone Father froze the fog and made snow.  Then they both held the fog, and the fog turned into water.  Then they held each other, and they made copper.

They used the things they had made to make more things.  They made soil and animals and plants.  They made many tribes of humans and monsters, and the tribes were all different.

Next, they used pieces of themselves to make things.  Fire Mother made the Sun and the Moon and the stars.  Stone Father made two worlds for their creations to live in.

Fire Mother and Stone Father put all the monsters in one world, and they put all the humans in the other world.  They made spirits to inhabit the two worlds and the places outside the worlds.  Finally, Fire Mother and Stone Father made a private place only for themselves, the Island of Fire.  Now, Fire Mother and Stone Father had places to go and things to talk about.

But the tribes they had made were childish and evil.  They fought each other.  They cursed Fire Mother and Stone Father, and then they forgot about them.  They worshipped the animals and the Sun and the spirits that Stone Father and Fire Mother had made.

The Kayhotul were the only tribe that remembered Fire Mother and Stone Father, so the Kayhotul were Fire Mother and Stone Father's favorite tribe.  But the Kayhotul didn't fare well among the other tribes.  The other tribes outnumbered them, and the other tribes had help from the spirits, and the Kayhotul dwindled.

When only a few Kayhotul were left, they appealed to Fire Mother and Stone Father for help.  The Kayhotul said, "Fire Mother and Stone Father, we are your favorite children, the only ones who remember you and respect you.  But we are dying, because your other children and the spirits are killing us.  Won't you please help us before we are gone?"  So Fire Mother and Stone Father took pity on the Kayhotul, and they made the Toknok, the white dogs, to defend them.  The Kayhotul thanked Fire Mother and Stone Father, and their numbers increased.

But the other tribes grew even more evil, and even with their Toknok to defend them, the Kayhotul dwindled.  The evil tribes pushed them to the very edge of the Human World.  So the Kayhotul appealed to Fire Mother and Stone Father again.  They said, "Fire Mother and Stone Father, we are your favorite children, the only ones who remember you and respect you.  But we are dying, because we must live on the edge of the world.  If the other tribes attack us again, we will be forced into the ocean beyond the edge of the Human World, and we will drown.  Won't you please help us before we are gone?"  So Fire Mother and Stone Father took pity on the Kayhotul, and they gave them boats and taught them to catch fish.  The Kayhotul thanked Fire Mother and Stone Father, and they used their boats to travel along the edge of the Human World and hide from the other tribes, and their numbers increased.

But the other tribes grew even more evil, and even with their Toknok and their boats, the Kayhotul dwindled.  The evil tribes attacked them wherever they landed, and they had to stay at sea all the time.  So the Kayhotul appealed to Fire Mother and Stone Father again.  They said, "Fire Mother and Stone Father, we are your favorite children, the only ones who remember you and respect you.  But we are dying, because the other tribes won't let us back into the Human World.  If we don't have land on which to rest and find water, we will die.  Won't you please help us before we are gone?"  So Fire Mother and Stone Father took pity on the Kayhotul.  Stone Father froze some of the ocean to make ice for the Kayhotul to live on, and Fire Mother melted some of the ice to make fresh water for the Kayhotul to drink.  The Kayhotul thanked Fire Mother and Stone Father, and their numbers increased.

For many generations, the Kayhotul lived on the ice and on the water.  They never again lived in the Human World, but they would sneak back there to take stones and wood.  They made dogsleds, and with their dogsleds and their boats they travelled widely.

They even found the Island of Fire, the private place of Fire Mother and Stone Father.  At first, Fire Mother was angry, and she threw fire at the Kayhotul to chase them from the island.  But Stone Father intervened and turned the fire to stone.  Stone Father said to Fire Mother, "The Kayhotul are our favorite children, and they can't live in the Human World.  Let them come to our island and take stones and wood, as long as they are respectful."  Fire Mother agreed, and she apologized to the Kayhotul, and she gave them hot water as a gift.

After many generations, Fire Mother and Stone Father grew bored and began arguing again.  Fire Mother got so angry that she melted all the ice, and the Kayhotul had to live on the Island of Fire.  Then Stone Father got so angry that he froze the whole ocean, and the Kayhotul couldn't catch fish, so the Kayhotul and their Toknoks went to sleep while they waited for Fire Mother to melt the ice again.  The arguments continue to this day, and that is why we have the seasons.

The Kayhotul continued to travel, and many of them lived far from the Island of Fire.  After many generations, the Kayhotul travelled so far that they found the Monster World.

Fire Mother and Stone Father said, "Since you can't live in the Human World, we will allow you to live in the Monster World, which has wood and animals and many valuable things."  But most of the Monster World was covered with ice, and what wasn't covered with ice was covered with monsters.  The monsters were even more dangerous than the evil tribes back in the Human World, and they ate Kayhotul and Toknok alike.  The Kayhotul wanted the things that the monsters had, but there was no safe place for them to live in the Monster World.

The Kayhotul appealed to Fire Mother and Stone Father.  They said, "Fire Mother and Stone Father, thank you for giving us a new place to live.  But we can't live among the monsters, because they will eat us.  Won't you make the monster world safe for us?"  So Fire Mother and Stone Father took pity on the Kayhotul.  They made this cave, which is called Tloknoskets.  Here, Stone Father gave the Kayhotul protection, and Fire Mother gave them warmth.  Fire Mother and Stone Father filled the cave with good things, like copper and eggs and guano, for the Kayhotul to use.  Fire Mother and Stone Father said to the Kayhotul, "Now, you have a home forever.  Here you can take shelter from the monsters, and you can sleep while the ice comes and goes."  The Kayhotul were happy to live in the cave, and they never went back to the Island of Fire, and Fire Mother and Stone Father were happy to have their privacy again.

The Kayhotul lived in the cave for many generations.  They would come out of the cave to fish and to steal from the monsters, and they would go back inside to sleep and to sing.

Then Stone Father grew ill, and strange things happened.  When Fire Mother and Stone Father argued, Fire Mother would melt the ice, but Stone Father couldn't bring it back.  Every year, there was less ice than the year before.  The ocean thawed completely, and then the ice in the Monster World began to melt.  The monsters increased in number and became restless.  New monsters appeared that the Kayhotul hadn't seen before.  The World of Monsters was in chaos, and it became even more dangerous than it had been before.  The Kayhotul were afraid to go out of their cave.

Again, the Kayhotul appealed to Fire Mother and Stone Father.  They said, "Fire Mother and Stone Father, thank you for giving us our home.  But now the ice is melting, and the monsters are running rampant, and we're afraid to go out and fish or collect the good things of the Monster World.  Won't you please bring the ice back and subdue the monsters?"  Stone Father listened, and he tried to bring the ice back, but he was too weak.  Fire Mother said, "We must help our favorite children, or they will die."  So Fire Mother and Stone Father discussed the problem, and they decided to sacrifice the monsters to save the Kayhotul.

Fire Mother and Stone Father made a new tribe of humans to live in the Monster World.  They were called the Kopeknak, or Monster Slayers.  They were tall, and they had hair on their heads like children, and they couldn't sleep through the winter like the Kayhotul.  But they were very good at slaying monsters, and they ate the monsters, and their numbers increased.  The Monster Slayers didn't have Toknok, the white dogs, but they tamed the smallest monsters, the dog monsters, and made them pull dogsleds.  Soon the Monster Slayers overran the monsters, and the Kayhotul could come out of their cave again.  They thanked Fire Mother and Stone Father, and they thrived, and there were as many Kayhotul as could fit in Tloknoskets.

The Monster Slayers grew bored when there were no more monsters to kill, so they split into separate tribes and made war on each other.  This was their nature; it was how Fire Mother and Stone Father had made them.  Sometimes, Fire Mother and Stone Father grew angry with their behavior and cursed them with plagues or famine, or if Stone Father felt strong, he would freeze them.  But these things only made the fighting worse.  The different tribes of Monster Slayers would fight horrible, desperate wars for survival, and sometimes whole tribes died out.

Sometimes, the Kayhotul would come out of their cave and find no Monster Slayers, because all the Monster Slayers in the area had died, or they had gone off to another part of the Monster World to pick fights or find food.  When there were no Monster Slayers around, the Kayhotul worried that the monsters might come back.  But whenever the Monster Slayers died or went away, new Monster Slayers eventually came to replace them, or sometimes the same Monster Slayers would return.  Usually, there were far more Monster Slayers than Kayhotul, and the Monster Slayers lived everywhere except in the cave.

Sometimes, the Monster Slayers attacked the Kayhotul.  But when the Monster Slayers came inside Tloknoskets, they always got confused and lost, and then they would panic and hit their heads.  The Monster Slayers were weak when they were inside the cave, and they were easy to kill.  Even if the Monster Slayers killed all the strongest Kayhotul outside, the old Kayhotul and the children and the sick people would kill the Monster Slayers when they came inside.  But outside the cave, the Monster Slayers were always stronger than the Kayhotul, and the Kayhotul could never attack them successfully.  Wars between the Kayhotul and the Monster Slayers never lasted very long, and mostly they lived as friends.  The Monster Slayers brought goods from every corner of the Monster World and traded them for copper from the Kayhotul's cave.

The Kayhotul taught the Monster Slayers to make boats.  The Monster Slayers, who were very clever, made even better boats than the Kayhotul.  They made great canoes with sails, and they sailed them out into the ocean, where the Kayhotul had once lived.  Fire Mother and Stone Father put monsters in the ocean, which made the Monster Slayers very happy.

One day, a great canoe with many Monster Slayers onboard lost its mast during a storm.  The Monster Slayers tried to paddle the great canoe home, but it was too far, and the wind and the current were against them.  They drifted for a long time, and some of them died.  They drifted all the way to the Human World, where they went ashore.

The Monster Slayers met one of the evil tribes, but they weren't afraid.  They fought with the evil tribe, and then they befriended them.  They stayed with the tribe for a long time, and they told each other stories and taught each other things, and they even had children together.

After one generation, some of the Monster Slayers, including some who had been born in the Human World, decided to come back to the Monster World.  One of the men from the evil tribe decided to come with them.  With help from those who stayed behind, they built a new canoe that was even bigger than the first, with a strong mast and a big sail.  They said goodbye to those who stayed behind, and they set sail.

The trip between worlds was very long and difficult.  By the time they got near the Monster World, their sail was ragged, and they were almost dead.  No other Monster Slayers were at sea, for it was their custom to go inland at certain times of the year.  Some Kayhotul were out fishing, and they saw the great canoe, and they gave the Monster Slayers water.

But when the Kayhotul saw who was in the canoe, they were afraid.  They saw the man from the evil tribe, who was even hairier than the Monster Slayers, and they saw other hairy people who were only half Monster Slayer.  The Kayhotul knew these people had come from the Human World.  The Monster Slayers said to the Kayhotul, "This man is our friend, and these people are our children, and they won't hurt you.  Please help us get to shore, or we will die."

The Kayhotul were angry.  They said, "You went to the Human World, and you met our ancient enemies.  You are strong, and you could have killed them.  But instead, you had children with them."

The Monster Slayers said, "We were not afraid of them.  We shared stories, and we taught them to make things, and they helped us make this great canoe so we could return."

The Kayhotul got even angrier.  They said, "By teaching them to make things, you made them stronger.  By telling them stories, you let them know where we are.  Now they will come to the Monster World and kill all of us, and the evil tribes will cover both worlds."

The Monster Slayers said, "The tribes of the Human World have forgotten you.  They don't want to come and kill you.  And we are strong, so they can't kill us.  Please help us mend our sail, and we will go ashore and be friends."

The Kayhotul said, "Because you have helped our ancient enemies, you must protect us from them.  You must promise that if the evil tribes come to our world, you won't tell them we are here."

The Monster Slayers said, "We promise not to tell them.  Now haul one of your boats on board, and we'll use its skin to patch our sail."

The Kayhotul helped the Monster Slayers, and the Monster Slayers went ashore.  When the Monster Slayers found their own tribe, they told many stories, and they showed them new things from the Human World.  All the Monster Slayers thanked the Kayhotul for what they had done, and they promised not to tell the evil tribes where the Kayhotul lived.

The Monster Slayers remembered their promise for many generations.  But their wars continued, and they still starved or froze occasionally, and then new Monster Slayers would appear outside Tloknoskets.

Sometimes, when a new tribe of Monster Slayers came, they wouldn't know about the Kayhotul or the promise.  They would meet the Kayhotul, and sometimes they would fight like before, and then learn that they couldn't kill the Kayhotul in Tloknoskets.  After they made peace, the Kayhotul would always tell them the story of the great canoes and the Human World and the promise.  Some tribes didn't believe the stories, and they thought the Kayhotul were superstitious.  But the Kayhotul always insisted that the Monster Slayers renew the promise, and they always did, even if they thought it was silly.

After many generations, the Monster Slayers forgot how to build great canoes, and they stopped going to sea.  But the evil tribes remembered what the Monster Slayers had taught them, and they made even better boats than the Monster Slayers.  After many generations, evil tribes came to the Monster World.

First came the Iron People, who carried swords.  The Iron People fought the Monster Slayers, then made peace with them, then lived alongside them.  They told the Monster Slayers that they had lived on the Island of Fire, and when the Kayhotul heard this, they were jealous.  The Monster Slayers remembered their promise, and the Iron People never came looking for the Kayhotul.  Eventually they went back to the Island of Fire without ever seeing a Kayhotul.

Next came the Longears, who came to fish and rarely came ashore.  Again, the Monster Slayers remembered their promise, and the Longears never saw the Kayhotul.

Finally, the Pukruh came, and they never left.  The Kayhotul saw the Pukruh ships, and they knew the ships came from the Human World, and they were afraid.  When the Kayhotul in their boats saw the ships, they paddled away from them.  Sometimes the ships came into the harbor, and the Kayhotul hid in Tloknoskets.

The Monster Slayers, who were never afraid of anything except Tloknoskets, saw the Pukruh in many places and talked with them.  They got diseases from the Pukruh, and most of them died.  Then the Kayhotul got sick with the Pukruh diseases, and most of them died, too, even though they hadn't talked to the Pukruh.  This was a terrible time, and Tloknoskets was almost empty.

The Pukruh fought the Monster Slayers and made peace, then fought and made peace, over and over.  Meanwhile, the Pukruh grew stronger and stronger.

The Monster Slayers told the Kayhotul about the Pukruh.  They told the Kayhotul about the Pukruh's two languages and their god and their houses.  The Monster Slayers said, "We have kept our promise, and the Pukruh have never heard of the Kayhotul.  But the Pukruh go everywhere, and they will find you soon.  Don't try to fight them, because we have tried it, and it doesn't help.  Don't try to make peace with them, because we have tried it, and that doesn't help, either.  Don't try to hide from them, because they will find you anyway."

The Kayhotul said to the Monster Slayers, "Then we will die!  What else can we do?"

The Monster Slayers said, "You must pretend to be Pukruh.  Some of the Pukruh look like Kayhotul.  If you learn to talk and live as they do, they will think you are Pukruh.  Build houses like the Pukruh.  Build one house with two crossed sticks on the roof, and go there once every seven days, and the Pukruh will think you are like them."

The Kayhotul didn't understand, and they despaired.  They said, "We can't talk like the Pukruh, and we can't build houses or live as they do.  And if they find us, they will kill us and take Tloknoskets for themselves."

The Monster Slayers said, "We will go home and think about it.  Tomorrow, we will tell you how to save yourselves."

The next day, the Monster Slayers came back, and they said to the Kayhotul, "We have a gift for you.  It will help you survive, but it will scare you.  You must promise that when we show you the gift, you will not run away."

The Kayhotul said, "We are not afraid of your gifts.  We are only afraid of the Pukruh."

The Monster Slayers laughed, and they said again, "You must promise not to run away."

The Kayhotul promised they wouldn't run away, even if the gift scared them.

Then the Monster Slayers showed them the gift, and it scared them.  The gift was a Pukruh man.  He was almost as tall as the Monster Slayers but as pale as the Kayhotul, and he had hair all over his body.

The Kayhotul did not run away, but they pointed their copper-tipped spears at the man.  The Kayhotul all shouted at the Monster Slayers.  They shouted in their own language, and they shouted in the language of the Monster Slayers.  They shouted, "You have broken your ancient promise!  You have brought this evil man to see us, and now the evil tribes will know we are here."

The Monster Slayers were very clever.  They said, "This man was born a Pukruh, but we have adopted him and made him a Monster Slayer.  So you see, we have not broken our promise.  And by the way, he speaks our language, and he can understand what we're saying."

The man smiled and greeted them in the Monster Slayer language.

Speaking in the Kayhotul language so the man wouldn't understand, the Kayhotul said, "This is a bad joke.  We are afraid, and you are giving us exactly what we fear."

The Monster Slayers who spoke the Kayhotul language said, "We are giving you the only thing that can help you.  This man knows the Pukruh's two languages, and he knows how to live like the Pukruh and build houses.  He learned our language quickly, and he will learn yours.  He will teach you to live like a Pukruh.  Then you can fool the Pukruh, and they will see you but not know you."

The Monster Slayers were good at diplomacy, so they knew when to lie and how to do it well.  They said to the man, "These people are the Kayhotul.  They are a Pukruh tribe, and they worship Stone Father and use copper, as you can see from their spears.  But they live in a cave, because they have forgotten how to build houses and live like the other Pukruh.  You must teach them to build houses, and you must help them build a house where they can worship Stone Father."

The man was very excited, and he said he'd be happy to do these things.  He smiled at the Kayhotul, even though they were glaring at him.

The Kayhotul said, in their own language so the man wouldn't understand, "What does worship mean?"  It was a word that didn't translate into the Kayhotul language.

The Monster Slayers said, "It means they think about Stone Father all the time, and they talk about him all the time, and they talk about his son, too."

"His son?  Who is that?  And what about Fire Mother?  Don't they love and respect Fire Mother, too?"

"They are afraid of Fire Mother.  This man will help you, but you must never tell him of your love for Fire Mother, and never tell him about the Island of Fire.  If you do, he will get scared and run away, and then he will tell the other Pukruh about you."

The man tried talking to the Kayhotul in the two languages of the Pukruh, and the Monster Slayers laughed.  They told him the Kayhotul didn't remember the Pukruh languages.

Then the Monster Slayers said to the man, "Now you must listen, because this is very important.  Our ancesters made a promise to the Kayhotul, and we have always kept it.  Remember that you are a Monster Slayer now, and you must keep the promise, too.  You must never tell the other Pukruh, or anyone else from your world, about the Kayhotul.  The Kayhotul crossed the ocean many generations ago, because people wanted to kill them.  If you tell the other Pukruh about them, then the other Pukruh will come and kill the Kayhotul and take their home.

"You must help the Kayhotul convince the other Pukruh that they are like them.  You must teach them to talk like you, and you must teach them to make clothes and boats like the other Pukruh make.  The other Pukruh must never know that the Kayhotul are different.

"We have kept the promise of secrecy for many generations, and you must not be the first to break it."

The man agreed, and he came to live with the Kayhotul.

The Kayhotul were very suspicious of the man, whose name was Joseph Putnam.  They wouldn't allow him inside Tloknoskets, so he had to sleep under a sealskin outside.  But he liked the Kayhotul anyway.  He thought about Stone Father all the time, and he believed that Stone Father had sent him to help the Kayhotul.

At first, Joseph Putnam spoke in the language of the Monster Slayers, which only a few Kayhotul understood.  But then he learned to speak the Kayhotul language so everyone could understand him.  He taught the young children to speak English and French so they could pretend to be Pukruh.

Joseph Putnam said to the Kayhotul, "Give me copper to trade with the Pukruh, and I will get iron so we can build a house for Stone Father."

The Kayhotul did not think Stone Father needed a house, because he lived with Fire Mother on the Island of Fire.  But they remembered what the Monster Slayers had said, and they never mentioned Fire Mother or the Island of Fire.  Joseph Putman explained that the house would have two crossed sticks on top, and they would go there every seven days, and the Kayhotul understood that this was the house the Monster Slayers had instructed them to build.

But the Kayhotul did not want to trade copper with the Pukruh.  Copper is sacred and rare and valuable.  They were afraid that if the Pukruh saw the copper from Tloknoskets, they would come looking for more copper and would steal it, and they might steal Tloknoskets itself.

The Kayhotul said to Joseph Putnam, "We will give you dried fish and sealskins to trade with the Pukruh, but never copper.  You must never tell the Pukruh that we have coppper, because then they will come and find us."

Joseph Putnam agreed, and he loaded a boat with the fish and skins, and one of the children who spoke the Pukruh languages got in the boat.  He and the child went away, and they came back with an axe and a saw.  Then he left with a different child and more fish and skins, and they came back with iron nails.  He and the Kayhotul built a house with two crossed sticks on top, and they went there once every seven days.  In the house, Joseph Putnam talked about Stone Father, and he taught the Kayhotul new songs, and he taught them about Stone Father's son.

Joseph Putnam and the Kayhotul built more houses, and the children learned to trade with the Pukruh for nails and tools and other useful things.  The Pukruh thought the Kayhotul were like them, and they left the Kayhotul alone.

Joseph Putnam loved the Kayhotul, and it made him very happy when the Kayhotul went to the special house and sang about Stone Father's son.  He grew old and died and never betrayed the Kayhotul.  Before he died, Joseph Putnam said, "Most Pukruh are evil, but some are good.  Some will help you, like I have.  If you are very careful, you might find a few more Pukruh who will help you."

Meanwhile, the Pukruh grew stronger, and the Monster Slayers grew weaker.  There came a time when many Monster Slayers pretended to be Pukruh, just as the Kayhotul did.  The Monster Slayers were so good at pretending to be Pukruh that some of them forgot they were Monster Slayers at all, and all of the Monster Slayers forgot about the Kayhotul.

The Kayhotul were also very good at pretending to be Pukruh, but they didn't forget who they really were, because Tloknoskets was always here to remind them.  When the Pukruh built mills, the Kayhotul built mills, too, and made new things to trade with the Pukruh.

Sometimes, just as Joseph Putnam said, the Kayhotul found Pukruh that they could trust, and the special Pukruh helped them.  The Kayhotul called them Putnams.  The Putnams taught the Kayhotul more things, and the Kayhotul learned to do everything the Pukruh could do.

With help from a Putnam, the Kayhotul learned to trade copper secretly, by sending the copper far away and tricking the Pukruh.

And that is why the Kayhotul are still alive, here in the Monster World, surrounded by the Pukruh and the forgetful Monster Slayers.  To this day, Tloknoskets, one of the gifts from Stone Father and Fire Mother, protects us and helps us remember who we are.  And to this day, we never speak of Fire Mother in front of Pukruh.  And to this day, the Pukruh do not know about Tloknoskets or its copper.

Fire Mother and Stone Father will always love the Kayhotul, and Tloknoskets will always be our home.  Other tribes will come and go, and Fire Mother and Stone Father will argue, and the ice and the water will come and go.  Some of our ancient enemies may yet find us and recognize us.  But Tloknoskets will always give us shelter from our enemies and from the whims of Fire Mother and Stone Father.
