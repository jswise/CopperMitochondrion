# Chapter 11

The more I learned about glaciers, the more I realized how insanely complicated they are. You'd think they'd be pretty simple -- I mean, they're just ice. But there's a lot of weird physics going on.

Consider what happens when the sun shines on a glacier. Some of the light bounces back into space, while some warms up the glacier. If the top of the glacier melts, the water might pool on the surface and then dribble down into a crack. Then it might refreeze, or it might find its way down to the bottom of the glacier. If there's enough water to make a continuous column from top to bottom, then the water at the bottom is under so much pressure that it can force its way under the ice, causing the glacier to float. I'm sure you can imagine that a glacier with water under it behaves a lot differently from one that just has rock under it. Meanwhile, the glacier is reshaping the ground over which it moves, the climate is changing, and of course the shoreline is moving back and forth.

Then there was the question of scale, which Zeke had brought up in his list of questions. If I tried to model the whole North American ice sheet, the model wouldn't have enough detail to be useful for finding minerals. I would need to cover a smaller area, like just Maine or just Grosvenor, in order for it to work. But if you're only going to model a small part of a system, you have to make assumptions about what the rest of the system is doing. Zeke had asked me what boundary conditions I would use, which is a concise way of asking what assumptions I would make about things like the amount of ice flowing in from elsewhere and the position of the shoreline. Hank had told me to assume that the shoreline was right where it is now, but I wasn't sure if that was valid. I started to think I would need to make a coarse model of the whole freakin' planet before I could even start on a fine model of a particular area.

I went up two flights of echoey stairs and plopped into Hank's office. "I'm worried about our assumptions," I said.

"What about 'em?"

"There are just too many of them. And I don't even know what they should be. I mean, how do we know how much ice is coming in from the rest of the continent, for one thing?"

He gave me a patronizing grin that seemed to say I was too naive to see that there was nothing to worry about. "Go to the literature," he said. "Use a commonly accepted value."

"And what about the interface between the ice and the rock? How do we know if there's water in there?"

"You can prob'ly assume it's channeled. If you just model the meltwater as disappearing, that's a pretty close approximation of flowing out to sea."

"But how do we know which things we can make assumptions about? I mean, if we make assumptions about everything, there won't be any variables left. Then the model won't do anything."

Hank chuckled. "We just need to limit the number of variables to something reasonable. All you really need are ice thickness and flow direction."

"And what about boundary conditions? Should we assume a constant thickness of ice at the edges of the study area, or should we assume a constant flow rate?"

He leaned back and thought about it for a few seconds. "Thickness is prob'ly more convincing. That way nobody could accuse us of having artificially thin ice. But make the sides a no-flow boundary."

"And the terrain is constant?"

"Sure. We only care about the terrain at the end of the glaciation, anyway. What happened before that doesn't affect our samples."

"So we have a square model with a constant thickness of ice on one side, no flow on two sides, and water on the other side. Is that right?"

"Yep."

"And we have constant terrain and constant sea level, right?"

"Exactly."

"So then we just see which way the ice goes? How will we know if we've got it right?"

"That's what the samples are for. We'll use 'em to calibrate the model."

I furrowed my brow and stared into space for a while, processing this. Things were getting a lot clearer, but they still didn't exactly make sense.

Hank said, "Don't try to make it too complicated. A simple model can tell you a lot."

When I left Hank's office, I was a little bit zombified. I had a class to go to, so I went down to my office, grabbed my coat and a clipboard full of paper, and wandered outside. All those assumptions and boundary conditions were swirling around in my head, and I was trying to figure out if there was anything solid enough to write a thesis about.

There was a snack bar in the Student Union Building, and I stopped in to get a slice of pizza. I was startled to see that Frances, the intriguing bald girl that I'd seen at a party, was standing in line.

I got in line behind her and wondered if I should try talking to her. She was looking up at the menu behind the counter, and she hadn't seen me. Then again, maybe she had seen me but didn't think anything of it. I wasn't sure if she would remember me at all, since we had ony spoken for a few seconds, and that had been months ago. I didn't want to make her feel awkward if she didn't know who I was, so I just stood quietly and waited to see if she'd notice me.

She was wearing an olive drab jacket with a small German flag on one sleeve, apparently a surplus item from the German army. She had a small, black backpack hanging from one shoulder. As I stood behind her, I could see the top of her head. Depending on your height, you might not think this is remarkable at all, but for me it's pretty rare to see the top of anybody's head. She smelled faintly of sunscreen.

There was something oddly sexy about her head. At first I just thought it had to do with her height and the fact that I could see it. After a while, though, I realized that there was something unusual about her hair. When someone shaves their head, they get a sort of five-o'clock shadow of the scalp. When someone goes bald, there's no hair at all; it's just smooth. As I stared at Frances's head, and by this time I really was staring, I saw that her head wasn't shaved, as I had assumed. She wasn't entirely bald, either. She had little, blonde hairs up there. Her head looked pretty much the same as her arm. She must have been born that way. Even though it was sexy, it was also kind of freakish.

Frances got her food and turned around. It was lucky that we had been standing in line, because that way it wasn't as shocking for her to turn around and see me staring at her. To my surprise, she seemed to recognize me. She said hi and even smiled.

I returned the greeting, then awkwardly turned away from her so I could order my pizza. I wondered if I should excuse myself or something, since I felt like I was wandering off in the middle of a conversation. When I got my pizza and turned around, I saw that she was at the soda fountain. It made me wish I had a cup.

Since our two-word conversation appeared to be over, I started to leave. Then I found out that she actually remembered my name.

"Ian!" she said. I stopped in the doorway, and she finished filling her cup and came toward me. "Where are you headed?"

"Um..." I looked down at the pizza on my greasy paper plate. "I was just headed to Wallace. I usually just eat while I'm walking."

"I'll walk with ya," she said. "You mind if I check my mail first?"

"Huh-uh."

She held up her drink and asked, "Could you hold this for me?"

"Uh-huh."

I used my clipboard as a tray to hold my pizza, and I took her cup. I followed her to the post office, which consisted of a small counter and a narrow, dead-end hallway full of mailboxes. We had to walk in single file to allow other students to get out of the little hallway, so it wasn't conducive to talking. I waited while, standing close to her box with a hamburger in one hand, she pulled out her mail and stuck it in her backpack. I thought about checking my own mailbox, but my hands were too full. "Thanks," she said, and she took her drink back. Then we walked single-file again through the crowded SUB. I kept my plate on my clipboard so I'd have a free hand to eat pizza. Finally, when we were out the door, we walked side by side, stepping carefully on the mixture of snow, slush, and ice that covered the walkway.

I asked, "Where are you going?"

"Oh, I don't know. I have to read a bunch of stuff, so I think I'll go sit in the library."

"Ah." I didn't know what else to say, so I took a bite of pizza.

Frances asked, "Do you have a class?"

"Ymph." I had forgotten that I had a mouthful of pizza. I put my hand over my mouth, swallowed, and said, "Yeah, I've got petrology at eleven."

"Petrology? Is that, like, the study of petroleum?"

"No, it's, um... well, we look at minerals through microscopes."

"Oh! Sounds cool. Are you a geology major?"

"Yeah, economic geology. It's like geology for mining."

"Huh."

"What's your major?" I immediately felt embarassed for asking that question, because it's a classic cheesy pickup line. She didn't seem to mind, though.

"Chemical engineering."

"Huh. You design chemicals?"

She laughed. "Chemical processes."

"Oh, I see."

We were approaching Wallace Hall. "Well," said Frances, "I'll let you finish your pizza so you can go look at minerals."

I laughed. I had virtually forgotten about my pizza, and I had only taken one bite of it.

"Yeah," I said. "It's good to see you again."

"What's your email address?"

I was flattered. "Oh, it's 'iadawson.' I-A-D-A-W-S-O-N."

She smiled and said, "Cool. I'll see ya around."

I went inside, stood by the door to the petrology lab, and crammed my pizza into my mouth.
