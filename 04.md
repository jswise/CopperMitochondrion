# Chapter 4

After my first day in class, Eleanore of Puppet House took me to a party.

We went in her Datsun, and I discovered that the inside of the car was loud and dusty. On her dashboard was a large collection of rocks, driftwood, and plastic people and animals. The collection as a whole looked like a Japanese garden in which several varieties of buggery were occurring.

"There's a pretty lively orgy happening on your dashboard," I said.

Eleanor leaned toward me, her eyes still on the road and her mouth open. "What?"

"I said it's a pretty lively orgy on your dashboard."

Eleanor glanced at the scene and made a sour face. Loudly, she said, "That's my friend Suzanne. She's always rearranging them. She found most of them, too. I think she must have some weird fetish about plastic animals."

Eleanor was wearing a loose-fitting plaid shirt that was spattered with paint. It looked like the shirts that art teachers keep in their classrooms for students to wear. In fact, I wondered if she had stolen it from an art room. Her baggy, khaki pants also had a lot of paint on them. She evidently made no distinction between painting clothes and party clothes.

More to make conversation than anything else, I said, loudly this time, "What's the occasion for the party?"

"Just the first day of the year. I've been here all summer, but most people went home. The party's at Dean and Igor's house. They were here for the summer, too."

"Is Igor someone's real name?"

"Nope. I'm not sure how he got it. You wanna stop and get some beer or something?"

"Sure."

We had been driving around the lake, and we crossed the railroad track that marked the edge of town. Eleanor pulled into a large parking lot in front of a grocery store. I immediately noticed a life-size fiberglass cow on the roof.

"What's with the cow?"

"Where?"

"On the roof!"

"Oh, yeah, that's always there. I don't know why. It's kinda surreal, I guess."

Rather than searching for a parking space close to the store, Eleanore zipped into a space on the fringe of the cars. When she turned the car off, the silence was startling.

As we walked toward the building, I asked, "Are you from Gabbro Falls?"

"No, I grew up in Millinocket. I just didn't go home for the summer."

"Why's that?"

"I dunno. I guess I feel like I came to school for a reason, and I'm not dying to get away all the time. Most people go home every weekend, like they can't do laundry or eat if they're not in their freakin' parents' house. It's kind of pathetic."

"Do you... " I stopped myself, abruptly realizing that I was about to ask a rather personal question. But since I'd already started, I couldn't very well just shut up and pretend I hadn't said anything. "Um, I don't mean to be nosey or anything, but do you get along with your parents?"

Eleanore laughed. "No worries. Yeah, we get along just fine. I visit them in moderation. I think it's a lot healthier than being connected to my mother with a bungee cord."

I saw a sign on the store that said "Agency Liquor Store," and I had no idea what that meant. Liquor laws vary so widely from state to state that I didn't know what we'd find in a grocery store. I soon found that Maine grocery stores have pretty much everything in the way of alcohol.

Eleanor went to a long cooler full of beer, walked to the end where the most expensive beer was, and picked out something dark and obscure. I was a lot less decisive, glancing around as if I might come across something really compelling. I rarely drink, and I'm never sure what to drink when I do. I just don't want it to be gross.

I asked, "Would people think it was too weird if I brought gin and tonic?"

Eleanore cringed and squealed, "Oh, that's so weird!" Then she straightened, calmed down, smirked, and said, "You can get whatever you want, Ian."

I felt a little silly for asking, but I was glad that she was tolerant of my eccentricities. I picked up a bottle of gin and a two-liter bottle of tonic water, wondering if I would drink enough to make a dent in them.

The party was in a long, narrow apartment above a storefront. I think people call those "railroad apartments." There were no hallways, just rooms you had to walk through to get to other rooms.

Igor had quit school to work at a minimum-wage job, which meant that he had more money than most college students and could afford two bedrooms for himself. One of his rooms was dedicated to electronic music, with a computer, several keyboards and synthesizers, and a collection of vinyl records by industrial bands of the 1980s, like Front 242 and Skinny Puppy. The most intriguing thing in the room was a Moog analog synthesizer from the early '70s, complete with a panel of patch cords that looked like an old-fashioned telephone operator's console.

Dean was a physics major who was really into Lego. He explained to me that evening that the proper word for a collection of Lego brand bricks and toys is "Lego," not "Legos." I think it has something to do with maintaining the integrity of the trademark. Anyway, he had Lego sheets on his bed, plastic storage bins full of Lego, and a variety of intricate models on display. Dean didn't share his housemate's affinity for industrial music, and he kept the stereo supplied with ska during the party.

I was sure I was the only grad student present. In fact, I was a little worried that I might get busted for providing alcohol to underage drinkers. The gin and tonic certainly went over well, as much for the novelty as anything else.

After spending a summer at the mine with a bunch of soccer moms and children, being in an apartment full of college students made my hormones come back to life. It seemed like every woman there was hot. I kept telling myself they were all too young, because I think there's something a little creepy about graduate students dating undergrads. But I was practically drooling, anyway.

One woman was particularly intriguing, though to be honest I wasn't sure why. It might have been partly because she was one of the few women I'd ever seen who were shorter than I was. Aside from that, her most striking feature was her shaved head. I know this is kind of weird, but I've always found women with shaved heads alluring, and you have to admit they're pretty rare. She also looked old enough to be a senior, so she was closer to my own age than most of the people there. I kept hoping I'd have some excuse to talk to her, but we never seemed to be in the same cluster of people.

I sort of clung to Eleanore, since she was the only person there that I knew, and that probably didn't help. It's not like Eleanore and I were on a date -- in fact, I had the impression that Eleanore was gay, although I hadn't asked. But she didn't have a big pink triangle on her chest or anything, so our relationship might have looked ambiguous. In other words, I looked as though I had the hots for her. And I have to admit that Eleanore was pretty cute.

I did meet several interesting friends of Eleanore's, so it was worthwhile. Between the economic geologists and Eleanore's friends, I was starting to feel like I knew some people, and I'd only been in town for a few days.

One girl at the party was on a mission. She had dark skin and black hair, and her cheeks were just chubby enough to give her a full-bodied smile. She also had a really nice body, which was helpful because she was on the hunt for genetic material. I don't mean she was trying to get pregnant, though she would have had no trouble doing that. This girl, whose name was Colleen, had some kind of experiment going on, and she wanted to get a sample of DNA from every person at the party.

If some random guy with bad teeth walked up to you and asked you for a sample of your DNA, I think I can safely assume that you wouldn't give it to him. But it's different when the person asking is a vivacious female college student. Her assertiveness made her more attractive, and her attractiveness made her proposition seem like fun. And she promised that she wouldn't record our names or anything else about us. Everybody she walked up to, regardless of their gender or sexual orientation, opened their mouths and let her swab their cheek cells.

Unfortunately, she happened to walk up to me at the most inopportune time. The alluring girl, the one with the shaved head, the one whose path I had hoped to intersect with all evening, happened to approach me and introduce herself while Eleanore was getting swabbed. Maybe she had just been waiting for Eleanore to get distracted.

Shyly, looking kind of embarassed, she said, "My name's Frances." She moved her beer from her right hand to her left and then reached out to shake my hand. It was an oddly formal gesture for a college party, but I was thrilled.

"Ian," I said, taking her hand. "I'm new here." I noticed that her hand was strong and feminine at the same time. It didn't feel like a man's hand, but it didn't feel fragile like most women's do.

At that moment, just as both of us were trying to think of something to say that might sound intelligent and lead to a conversation, Colleen tapped my back and said, "How about you? You wanna give me some cheek cells?"

I let go of Frances's hand and gave her my best apologetic look. Then I turned to Colleen and opened my mouth.

Colleen put a little plastic stick in there and brushed it gently across the inside of my cheek. It was oddly exciting to have this little moment of intimacy with an attractive stranger, her face close to mine as she peered into my mouth. Then she withdrew the stick and rubbed her prize onto what looked like a small notecard with spots on it.

"What are you gonna do with those?" I asked.

She smiled. "I'm doing a statistical study of mitochondrial DNA. I just want to find out how different everybody is."

"But isn't it kind of pointless if you don't know whose DNA is which?"

"Naw, I don't care whose it is. I just have to make sure I don't get the same person in here twice."

"You'd think we were twins, huh?"

She gave me a different smile this time, just a flicker of a smile that made me suddenly wonder if I'd said something stupid. "Just siblings, actually," she said. "All your mitochondrial DNA comes from your mother, so it's identical to your siblings'. Thanks!"

With that, our little encounter was over. By this time, she had a new card and a new swab ready, and she said, "How 'bout you?"

I turned and was astonished to see that Frances was no longer standing next to me. Colleen was addressing a guy named Matt that I had met a few minutes earlier, and Frances had disappeared.

I quickly finished my gin and tonic so I'd have an excuse to go to the kitchen. I walked through every room in the apartment, trying not to look conspicuous or like I was desperately trying to find someone to talk to, and I didn't see Frances. She had left the party.

Fortunately, Eleanore didn't drink much, so I still had a ride home. In the car, she shouted, "So, what do you think of your first Mines party?"

"It was fun. Thanks!"

"Those guys are pretty cool. I've got some of Igor's music at home; you can listen to it sometime. It's pretty kooky."

I looked out the window for a minute, wondering if I should mention what I was thinking about. Finally, I said, "Do you know Frances?"

"Francis? Is that a guy or a girl?"

"A girl. The short one with the shaved head."

"Oh!" She scowled as if I had mentioned something obscure and distasteful. "Yeah, sort of. Why?"

"I dunno. I thought she was kinda cute."

Eleanore raised her eyebrows in amazement. "Really?"

I became self-conscious. I looked sideways at her and said, "Yeah. Why, are you surprised?"

One eyebrow went down, but the other one stayed up. "Yeah. I think she's kinda creepy. You really think she's cute?"

Now I felt downright defensive. "Well, you know, I didn't really get a chance to talk to her, but yeah, she seemed pretty interesting."

"Interesting, yeah. In a creepy sort of way."

"What's creepy about her?"

"I dunno. I don't really talk to her much, but she just gives me the creeps. I can't say what it is, just something about her gives me the heebie-jeebies."

"Hmm. Well, maybe I'll get the heebie-jeebies if I ever get to talk to her. She started to introduce herself tonight just as that biology girl..."

"Colleen?"

"Yeah, just as Colleen came up to swab my cheek cells. I guess she got annoyed and left."

"Is she shorter than you?"

I thought that was a startlingly random thing to say.

"Um, yeah. Or at least I think she is, because she didn't seem normal."

"Heightwise?"

"Heightwise."

"Does everybody seem tall to you?"

"Well, no... actually, I don't really notice when people are tall. I look up at just about everybody, so everybody seems about the same height to me."

"Yeah," said Eleanore, "I'm the same way. When you came to the house that first time, I knew there was something weird about you, but I couldn't place it. It's 'cause you're shorter than me. I'm not used to that."

"Thanks! That's really flattering."

Eleanore produced a laugh that started with one forceful "Ha!" and rapidly decayed. "It's not like I think you're a freak or anything. I'm glad that somebody's shorter than I am."

"And I'm glad I can help you with your self-esteem."

"Ha!"

Half a minute later, as we pulled into the driveway, Eleanore said, "So, is it because Frances is so short that you have the hots for her?"

"No, it's not like I go out looking for short women. I don't care about height." A second later I realized what Eleanor had actually said, and I replied, "I didn't say I have the hots for her, anyway. I just think she's interesting."

"Mmm."
