# Chapter 13

For a little while, I thought about trying to get in touch with Zeke to find out what was up with the Bandalero Mine.  I thought I might even go visit him in Arizona if I went there for Christmas.

I asked the department secretary if she knew where to find him, and she said he never left any contact information or checked his email in the winter.  I thought it was strange that a professor could just take off like that.  The secretary explained that he was essentially a volunteer, so he could do whatever he wanted.  Everybody was used to it.

Next to the geoscience mailboxes, which were really just cubbyholes, there was a cardboard box where Zeke's winter mail collected.  It was all just scientific junk mail, such as conference fliers and catalogs of lab equipment.  Everybody knew about his habits, so nobody sent him any real mail in the winter.

For lack of anything better to do, I left him the map I had printed before I left the library, with the Bandalero mine overlaid on Grosvenor.  I just wanted him to know, whenever he got back, that I knew something fucked-up was going on.

On the Monday before finals week, I went to Eleanore's studio late at night.  I had been studying in my office all day, and I needed to get out for a few minutes.  I sat on a stool while Eleanore worked on a sculpture made of PVC pipe, which I guess she had to do for some kind of final exam.  Her studio was full of fine, white sawdust and the smell of glue.

As she fitted a length of pipe into an elbow, she said, "You remember Dean and Igor?  We went to a party at their house."

"You mean the Lego guy and the synthesizer guy?"

"Yeah.  They're throwing another party this Friday.  It's a big end-of-the-semester thing."

"Isn't it a little early?  We haven't had finals yet."

Eleanore picked up a tape measure and a Sharpie pen and measured some pipe.  "They wanna make sure they do it before everybody leaves.  You remember Colleen, the bio major?"

"I'm not sure."

"She swabbed your cheek cells."

"Oh, yeah!  I remember that."

She glanced at me.  "Titillating, huh?  She wants to swab everybody again.  She wants to make sure everybody she got the first time is there again."

Eleanore put a length of pipe on the edge of a table, and I waited while she noisily sawed it with a handsaw.  When she finished, I asked, "Is she still working on the same project?  Isn't she an undergrad?"

"I think she finished the project but then kind of kept working on it.  She found something weird, I guess, and her professor thinks it might be important.  You know Paul Hodgdon?"

"No."

"He's a bio professor.  She's working with him on some kind of special project.  Dean was all excited when he told me about it.  He says she could get into... um, what's that journal that they talk about on NPR sometimes?"

"They talk about a journal on the radio?"

"Yeah.  Um, Nature.  They're always saying, 'In an article published today in the scientific journal Nature...'"

I nearly fell off my stool.  "You're shitting me!"

"I'm just telling you what Dean said.  Why, is Nature a big deal?"

"That's like... that's like if they put one of your paintings in the freakin' Guggenheim.  If she got published in Nature, she could pick any grad school she wants.  Are you sure that's what Dean said?  Are you sure she's not just delusional?"

Eleanore sat down on an easel bench with the pipe in her lap.  "Yes, and no.  That is what Dean said, but I don't know if she's delusional."

"What did she find?"

"I guess somebody had weird DNA.  Like, there are certain groups of people, and she found somebody that's in a new group.  I dunno.  You can ask her about it at the party."

"Who was it?"

"That's the thing.  She didn't write anybody's names on the samples, 'cause it wasn't part of the project.  Now she wants to find out who it is, so she has to get everybody again and write their names down."

"How will she make sure she gets everybody?"

"She's buying a keg."

I laughed.  "Does she have a grant for that?"

"It's an investment in her career."  Then she grinned.  "Maybe it was that girl you liked, the one that looks like she's from Grosvenor."

"Are you saying I'm attracted to freaks?"

"Haven't we already established that?"

Maybe it was a good sign that Eleanore made fun of Frances, because Frances sent me an email a couple days later.  She asked if I wanted to meet at the SUB for lunch the next day.  I was psyched.

As I walked to the SUB, I had a hard time convincing myself that she would actually be there.  Then I worried that if she was there, I might not see her.  I imagined us both sitting alone at different tables, each thinking the other had stood us up.

I was relieved to see Frances sitting in one of the hard, plastic booths near the pizza counter.  She grinned and waved when I got in line.

When I sat down, we had one of those awkward question-and-answer sessions in which each question begins with the word "so," as in, "So, what have you been up to?"  After a while, she casually brought up something that was probably her whole reason for inviting me to lunch.

"Hey, did you know The Untoward Sorcerer is coming out this Friday?"

"Who's that?"  After I asked the question, I immediately felt like an idiot.

Frances tried to look polite.  "Um, it's a movie.  Haven't you heard of it?"

"I don't think so.  I don't really watch TV, so I don't usually hear about new movies."

"But you've heard of the book, right?"

"Um, nope.  I don't read much fiction."  I was making myself sound really boring.

"It's really good, and I really wanna see the movie.  You wanna go?"

"Sure!  Is it playing here in town?"

She laughed.  "No, you have to go to a theater with more than one screen to see it.  I think the closest place is Augusta."

"Where's that?"

For the first time, I noticed that Frances had no eyebrows, or at least none that I could see.  I noticed because she was looking at me like I was insane, and she would have raised one eyebrow if she could.  Instead, she just sort of scrunched up half her forehead.  Then she said, "It's the capital of Maine."

I nodded and said, "Mmm."  I hoped to give her the impression that I knew that without actually lying.  I thought of the geologic maps I had looked at and tried to remember if there was a big star on them somewhere.  I didn't remember seeing it.  I said lamely, "I haven't really seen much of Maine yet."

"I'll drive," she said.

"Good.  What does 'untoward' mean?"

"I dunno.  I read the book, but they didn't really explain it.  It's kind of like how in The Crucible, they never say what a crucible is.  I had to read that play in high school, but I didn't know what a crucible was until I took metallurgy."

"Oh!  I forgot something.  Have you heard about Dean and Igor's party?  Colleen is looking for cheek cells again, and she wants everybody she got last time to go get swabbed again.  You remember that party at the beginning of the year..."  I was about to say "where we met," but that sounded too romantic somehow.

"Oh yeah, Colleen told me about that.  I told her about the movie, and she's gonna swab me ahead of time.  I can get a swab for you, too.  I know how to do it."

"Okay."  Getting swabbed by Frances sounded like a great idea.  I smiled, and she smiled, and then I felt a bit awkward about the fact that we were both thinking about her sticking something in my mouth.

On Friday, I met Frances at her dorm room.  She was decked out in rubbery L.L. Bean boots, wool pants, and a T-shirt with a chemical company logo on it.  She put on a big, yellow parka that looked like it was designed for an alpine expedition, then topped it off with a hat that had earflaps, much like the one Elmer Fudd wears.  She looked delightfully goofy.

Her car was an old Volvo station wagon that was so rusty I thought it might collapse.  It had lumpy areas around the bottom where someone had apparently patched it with fiberglass and then painted it.  Most of the car was white, but the driver's door and the tailgate were both dark blue.  When she started it, it wasn't quite as loud as Eleanore's car, but it was clearly a victim of Maine's epidemic of rusty exhaust systems.

The "so" questions began immediately.  She asked if I had ever read The Untoward Sorcerer, though we had already established that I had never heard of it.  Then we talked about how quickly cars rust in Maine, due to the fact that they spread salt on the roads when it snows.

I said, "My car is probably the oldest one in Gabbro Falls.  It doesn't have any rust on it, but I guess it'll start rusting soon."

"Don't cars rust in Arizona?" she asked.

"Not really, at least where I live.  There's no salt on the roads, and there's barely any rain.  There's nothing to make them rust."

There was something odd about her question, but it took me a second to figure out what it was.  Then I asked, "How did you know I was from Arizona?"

"Oh, I saw your license plate."

"Oh," I said, but then I was puzzled again.  "When did you see my car?"

She smiled.  "Oh, I've seen you around the campus."

It was nice to think that she had been paying attention to me, even when I didn't know she was around.  I guess that sounds a little like stalking, but the thought of being stalked by Frances was kind of alluring.

We were silent for a while, and then I asked her where she was from.

"I'm a local girl," she said.

"You're from Gabbro Falls?  I don't think I've met anyone who was from here."

"Not exactly.  I'm from Grosvenor, which is about an hour away."

I gaped at her for a few seconds.  All I could think was that if Eleanore was here, she'd be laughing her ass off.  Then I got myself together and said, "Really?  I was just there for the first time recently."

"Whadja think?"

"It was, um, kind of odd, actually."  Afraid of insulting her, I quickly added, "I haven't spent much time in Maine, and it's a lot different from what I'm used to."

She gave me an understanding smile.  "It's an odd town."

"My grandmother was from Grosvenor.  I probably still have relatives there."

"Yeah, prob'ly.  What was her name?"

"Her maiden name was DuFresne."

"Oh, yeah, I know some DuFresnes.  What was her first name?"

"Marguerite."

"Hmm.  Yeah, I prob'ly woulda been too young to know her."

The next question begged to be asked, but I was afraid to bring it up.  I was afraid it might offend her, and I was afraid of the answer.  After gathering my nerve for a little while, I asked, "So, are we related?"

She laughed.  "Did they tell you everbody's related in Grosvenor?"

I shrugged and probably blushed.  "Yeah, pretty much."

"It's not like we're hillbillies or something.  We're just not yuppies like the rest of the coast."

"Sorry.  The only other person I know from Grosvenor is Doctor... um, Doctor Gray."

She laughed again.  "You mean Doctor Gnome?"

I think I blushed again.  "Yeah, that's the one."

"He's a freak.  Not everybody in Grosvenor is like Doctor Gnome."

For the first time since I came here, I started thinking that having Grosvenor genes might not be so bad.

When we reached Augusta, we bought our tickets early and then got some fast food.  The more we talked, the easier it got, and the number of "so" questions decreased.  After the movie, as we drove back to Gabbro Falls, Frances talked at length about the differences between the movie and the book, and I actually felt like I was having a normal conversation.

When we got back, I went up to her dorm room to get swabbed.

The room had a bunkbed, even though Frances was the only one living there.  She had removed the mattress from the bottom bunk and put it on the floor next to a wall, so it was sort of like a couch without legs.  She had covered it with a sheet and leaned some pillows against the wall, and an old trunk served as a coffee table.  The bedspring where the mattress used to be was covered with books, clothes, and other random clutter.

I said, "I see you found a solution to the bunkbed problem."

Frances, who was taking off her big, yellow coat, asked, "Whaddya mean?"

"I have a bunkbed, too.  I can't really sit on the bottom bunk, 'cause there's not enough headroom.  I never thought to take the mattress off and do something useful with it.  I'm not even sure it's detachable.  It's a weird, 1970s built-in."

I noticed a guitar that was sitting on the bedspring.  It looked odd somehow, but I had a hard time figuring out why.  I'm no musician, and I don't really know what a guitar is supposed to look like.  I studied it for a while, and then I realized what was different about it.

I turned around, and I was startled to see that Frances, who had been wearing wool pants when we walked in, was now wearing boxer shorts with the School of Mines logo on them.  I had seen other women wear boxers like that around campus as if they were regular shorts.  I didn't know if Frances had changed into them while I wasn't looking or had simply taken off her pants.

In any case, I was glad, and it was hard not to ogle her cute little white legs.  Not only were they nice to look at, but it was December, and it had been months since I had seen any woman wearing shorts.  Frances acted nonchalant, but a slight grin told me she knew she had surprised me.

I forgot what I had turned around to say.  "Um..." My hand was limply pointing at something behind me, and I turned back to see what it was.  Ah yes, the guitar!  I looked at Frances again, careful to look at her face and not her legs.  "Is that a fretless guitar?  I mean, obviously it doesn't have any frets, but, um, what's up with that?"

"Yeah," she said.  "A guy in Grosvenor made it.  It's cool, 'cause you can play any note you want, or use a slide if you want."  She pointed at the ersatz couch.  "If you sit over there, I'll swab you."

I took off my coat, tossed it on the bedspring, and sat down on the mattress.  Frances stood by her desk for a moment with her back turned, so I got a chance to ogle her fully.  When she turned around, she was holding a little card and a plastic stick like Colleen had used.

Frances came over to the mattress, sat down crosslegged, and said, "Say 'Ah!'"  She leaned close to me and peered into my mouth as she sought her sample.  She poked the inside of my cheek with the end of the stick, and I winced.  She yanked the stick out of my mouth and looked embarassed.  "Sorry!  I've never done this before."

"It's okay.  Did you get the cells?"

"No, I need to try again."

I opened my mouth.  This time, she put one hand on my shoulder to steady herself, and she entered my mouth more gingerly than before.  With an expression of intense concentration, she gently wiped my cheek and withdrew the stick.  Then she took her hand off my shoulder, picked up the card, and wiped my cheek cells onto the spots on the card.  She picked up a pen off the coffee table and slowly said "Ian Dawson" as she wrote my name on the card.

I was a little surprised.  "How did you know my last name?" I asked.

She grinned.  "It's in your email address."

"Oh, yeah!"

Frances got up and went back to her desk with the card.  I wasn't sure if I should stay on the mattress or get up and leave.  I didn't want to leave, of course, but I didn't know if Frances had anything in mind other than swabbing.  I looked around the room, wondering what I should do next, and I noticed something unusual on the windowsill.  This provided a good opportunity for me to get up without actually leaving.

I got up and walked toward the window.  What I saw was a sheet of copper about the size of a standard sheet of paper.  It had been oxidized to a red patina, rather than the usual green, and it had letters etched into it.

I pointed at it and asked, "What's this?"

"Oh, that's something I made.  You can pick it up if you want."

I picked it up, felt the etched letters, and read what they said.  I had expected standard knick-knack material, such as a quote from Thoreau or Lao-Tzu, but it appeared to be a random page from a technical book.

Frances came toward me.  "It's a page from my statics book," she said.  She was referring to an introductory engineering class.  She stood next to me, closer than I had expected, almost touching me with her shoulder.

"How did you make it?"

"It's kinda like making a circuit board.  I wanted to see if I could do it with a page from a book."

"I can't say I've ever made a circuit board."

"It's kinda complicated.  I mean, when they do a bunch of 'em in a factory it's pretty easy, but making one at a time is kinda hard.  I photocopied the page onto clear plastic, then I laid the plastic onto a photosensitive silkscreen like a contact sheet, so I got a silkscreen that was open where the white space is and not where the letters are.  I mean, it printed a negative image."  She looked at me to see if I was following her, and I nodded automatically.  Then she said, “So I printed it onto the copper and then etched it with acid, and it only etched where the letters were.  I think there's prob'ly an easier way to do it, like photosensitizing the copper, but I haven't figured it out yet."

I didn't exactly know what she was saying, but I thought it was cool that she did whatever it was.

Frances turned and walked toward the bunkbed.  "Did your grandmother ever sing to you -- the one from Grosvenor?"

I set the copper back on the windowsill and turned around.  "Yeah, she did.  Is that a Grosvenor thing?"

She picked up the fretless guitar, then sat crosslegged on the floor-couch.  She grinned and said, "Yeah, it's a Grosvenor thing.  Do you remember what she sang?"

I walked toward her and said, "Um, sort of.  Only vaguely.  I never knew the names of the songs or anything.  They were all in French, and I don't speak French."

I sat down next to her.  I wasn't sure how close to her I should sit, so I sat just a little closer than what would normally seem appropriate.

She picked something up off the coffee table.  It was a sort of clip that she attached around the neck of the guitar.  I had seen people use clips like that to change the pitch of a guitar, but this one was different.  It had padding on it to dampen certain strings.  She strummed the guitar, and only the top two strings made noise.

She played a few notes on those two strings, moving her hand rapidly up and down the neck.  Surprisingly, it sounded familiar.

Frances stopped and asked, "Did she play that one?"

"Yeah," I said, nodding and staring at the coffee table.  "That's weird.  I didn't think I could remember any of her songs, but I do kind of remember it now."  I hummed the notes she had played, and then I continued humming the rest of the tune, though I was a bit uncertain about it.  Frances played along with my humming, and we went all the way through the first verse.

"Right on!" she said.  "How old were you the last time you heard that?"

"Oh, jeez, I must have been about five."

"Do you remember the words?"

"Um, well, I don't speak French, so I'd probably mangle them."

"Try it.  I'll sing with you."

She played again.  After she sang the first few syllables, I joined in, and the words came automatically.  I had no clue what the words meant, but I knew the sounds.  We got through two and a half verses before I faltered, and then I picked it up again on the third verse.  I sang all the way to the sixth and last verse.

"Wow!" I said.  "I had no idea I remembered that.  What's it about?"

"It's about how to build a boat.  You did good, even though it sounds like country western sitar music when I play it."

"What do you mean?"

"All the sliding.  I'm not very good at picking my finger up off the strings between notes."

"Do you just use one finger to play all that?"

"Yeah, I put one finger on both of these strings.  The other ones don't do anything."

"I though guitar players used all their fingers and played lots of chords and stuff."

"Yeah, but this is a different kind of playing.  What did your grandmother use?"

"You mean the instrument?  She had a really old, weird, lute sort of thing.  I think it was made of copper.  I guess..."  I thought for a second.  "I guess it only had two strings, so it sounded like your guitar does when you have that padded thing on it."

"Is it still around?"

"Um... I never thought about it.  She moved back to Maine when I was little, and she died there... here, I mean.  I don't know what happened to her stuff.  I didn't inherit it from her, if that's what you mean."

"That's too bad.  We could play together."

After a few seconds, we both laughed self-consciously about her statement.

"Here," she said, "I'll show you how to play this.  Turn around."

I turned my back to her, and she scooted toward me until her gorgeous legs were on both sides of me.  Now I could look at them freely, since they were the only part of her that I could see.

She reached around me with the guitar and put it in my lap.  I held it like I was playing it, though I didn't know where to put my left hand.

"First," she said, "just hold the neck and strum, so you can hear what the strings sound like when you're not holding 'em down."

I did what she said.

"Now, remember Pythagoras?"

"The triangle guy?"

"Um, maybe I don't mean Pythagoras.  Who was that Greek guy who played octaves?"

"I don't remember.  Maybe it was Pythagoras."

"Whatever.  Just push the strings down in the middle and play them again."

"How do I know where the middle is?"

"It's about here."  She wrapped her left hand around mine and moved it.  Then she put her head on my shoulder, reached around me with her right arm, and strummed the strings.  She moved my left hand a little and strummed them again.  "That's it.  You can tell if you just push the top string down."  She pressed the tip of my finger onto the string and strummed again.  "See?  They sound the same now."

"You mean they're tuned an octave apart?"

"Yeah."

We continued with the lesson for a while and then, as you've probably guessed, we had sex.  I won't go into all the details.

The next morning, it snowed heavily, which made the world preternaturally cozy.  We pretty much spent the whole weekend in bed, only leaving Frances's room to eat or romp in the snow.  I was afraid to drive home anyway, partly because my car didn't have snow tires and partly just because driving in snow terrifies me.

On Sunday night, when the roads were clear and we both needed to study for finals, I finally went home.  Frances promised she'd give my cheek cells to Colleen the next day.
