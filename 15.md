# Chapter 15

During finals week, the students trickled away, each one heading home after their last test.  I'm not sure what day Frances left, but I didn't see her at all that week.  Kieffer, my housemate, left on Wednesday.  Eleanore wasn't planning to go home until Christmas Eve, so she stuck around and worked in her studio.

I wasn't planning to go anywhere.  My father and I agreed that traveling from Maine to Arizona during the busiest flying time of the year would just be frustrating and expensive.  I was a little worried about him, since it was his first Christmas by himself, but he said he'd be spending Christmas with a friend of his and her family, and I would be bored anyway.  I got the impression that this friend of his was a girlfriend and that he was secretly glad I wasn't coming.

I thought about going to Arizona for other reasons.  I tried Googling Zeke to see if I could find out where his winter home was, but I only found his Gabbro Falls address and a lot of references to his research.  I drove by his house in Gabbro Falls, just to see if he was secretly spending the winter there, but the driveway was buried in snow, and it was obvious that no one was living there.  I also considered going to Arizona just to see the Bandalero Mine, but I decided there wasn't much point.  I knew that on the surface it would look like any other abandoned mine, and I wouldn't learn much from it.  I could measure the waste pile and calculate its volume, but I was pretty sure I knew it would be small.  I was better off waiting and asking Zeke about it in the spring.

After my last test on Thursday afternoon, I decided to spend the next few days relaxing and then get back to work on Monday.  I still hadn't answered most of Zeke's questions, and the winter break seemed like as good a time as any to work on those.  Considering how much weirdness I'd found answering the question about the Bandalero Mine, I was curious to know what other bizarre stuff would turn up when I got into the really irrelevant-looking questions.

On Friday morning,  Eleanore and I were both up early, despite the fact that we had nowhere to be.  The house was chilly, as if the end of finals marked the beginning of really cold weather.  Eleanore turned the thermostat up.

Eleanore said, "Just so you know, I'll prob'ly be gone all weekend.  Kaia's going home on Monday, so I'm going to see her today."

Kaia was a girl that Eleanore had hooked up with at Dean and Igor's party.  I filled in the blanks:  "And you're planning to fornicate all weekend?"

Eleanore shrugged and smirked.  "We'll prob'ly do other stuff too, like... I dunno... drink hot chocolate or something."

"I hope eating and sleeping will figure in there somewhere, unless you're on some kind of sexual vision quest."

"Is that what you and your little friend did last weekend -- a sexual vision quest?"

"You're just jealous."

"You're just jealous 'cause Frances went home, and Kaia's still here."

"Yeah, but we can commiserate on Monday."

"Yeah, we'll be pining away and wishing we had our respective sex slaves."

Then, on a wholly irrelevant note, she said, "Hey, did you know the libe is closing for the break?"  Eleanore, like a lot of other undergrads, used the word "libe" to refer to the library.

"No," I said, "that sucks.  I was planning to do some work there."

"They're open 'till noon today."

"I'd better head over there, then.  I was planning to stay home today, but I'd better dig some stuff up before they close.  Is everything shutting down for the break?"

"We'll still be able to get our mail, but that's about it.  Anyway,"she looked at her watch, "I'm gonna go over to my studio for a while.  I'd offer you a ride, but..."

"But then you'd have to take me to Kaia's house and make me your sex slave."

Eleanore put her coat on.  "Yeah, and I don't think we've reached the point in our relationship where we can bring in an extra sex slave."

"You mean you and Kaia or you and me?"

"Both.  But you and I are a long way from the sex slave stage."

"That's a pity.  How can you go to your studio when your sex slave awaits?"

"She has a final this morning.  Why do you think I'm not there already?"

"Separation masochism?"

Eleanore waved her car keys and said, "See ya!"

As she walked out the door, I shouted, "Don't forget the hot chocolate!"

I drove to the campus and checked my mail.  There were only a few other people in the SUB, and one of them recognized me.  "Hey," he said, "you missed the party!"

I was dumbfounded at first, but then I figured out that he was Dean the Lego Guy, at whose house I'd been swabbed the first time.

"Oh, yeah.  I donated my cheek cells, though."

"Oh, bummer.  I mean, I was hoping maybe she'd missed somebody."

"What do you mean?"

"She didn't get the same results this time.  She tried to get everybody -- she even got a bunch of people she hadn't done the first time."

"What's that all about?  I just heard about it from Eleanore."

"Oh, man, she was so close!  The first time, she thought she'd found a new lineage that would push Mitochondrial Eve way back.  You know Mitochondrial Eve?"

"No, I don't think I've met her."

He laughed.  "You know anything about mitochondrial DNA?"

I shook my head.  "I'm a geologist."

"Oh, okay.  You know what mitochondria are?"

"Um, the little things in your cells that make energy?"

"Yeah, well, they process energy, anyway.  They're like fuel cells for your cells.  Anyway, they have their own DNA.  They're like their own little organisms living inside your cells."

"That's fucked up."

"Yeah, it's weird.  Anyway, all your mitochondria come from your mother's mitochondria; you don't get any from sperm.  So all your mitochondrial DNA comes from your mother."

"And who's Mitochondrial Eve?"

"If you look at lots of people's mitochondrial DNA and look at the differences, you can see where mutations have happened over time.  You can see how some people are more closely related than others.  If you trace it back, looking at how fast the stuff prob'ly mutates, you can trace it all back to one woman who lived a hundred thousand years ago."

"But that would mean we're all totally inbred."

"Yeah, well, kinda mitochondrially inbred.  There were prob'ly other women around at the same time, and we're prob'ly descended from them, too.  They just didn't pass on their mitochondria.  Maybe some of them had all boys, and some had all male grandchildren, or whatever.  But there prob'ly weren't very many people.  It was prob'ly a bottleneck, a time when the population got really small for some reason.

"There's also a Y Chromosome Adam, a guy that all of us are also descended from.  But he lived a lot earlier; they weren't around at the same time.  It's just chance that we all ended up with his Y chromosome and her mitochondria."

"So, what did Colleen find?"

"There are lots of lineages of mitochondria.  They're like strains.  When there's a mutation, it starts a new lineage.  It's like how if somebody changed the way they spelled their last name, then all their descendents would be the... you know, people who spelled their name a certain way."

"I get the idea."

"Colleen thought she'd found a new lineage.  I mean, it wasn't even close to the ones people know about.  It couldn't have come from Mitochondrial Eve, which would mean she wasn't really Mitochondrial Eve after all.  It would mean that somebody at Mines wasn't descended from her, or at least she wasn't their mother's mother's mother.  It would mean there were other humans at the same time as Eve who prob'ly lived in some other place.  There'd be two parallel bottlenecks."

"But did she really find it?"

"That's the thing.  She can't reproduce it.  If you could point to a person and say, 'This guy has weird mitochondria,' that would be one thing.  But to say that an undergrad found some weird mitochondria at a party, well, that's not gonna convince anybody.  They'll just think she spilled beer on it, or the lab she sent it to screwed up, or something."

"What do you think?"

"I dunno.  Colleen's sure she did everything right, but who knows what happened when she sent it away for analysis?  Nobody'll really know unless she finds the person again."

"Bummer.  That would be pretty cool."

"Yeah.  So if you know anybody that didn't get swabbed the second time, be sure to have them tell Colleen."

"Yeah, I will."

"I gotta run.  I'll see ya, man."

"See ya."

I went to the library and photocopied a bunch of articles that I thought I might need.  Now I had my own little collection like Hank's.  I also got some books to read for fun, though I have to admit that I picked books I thought might help me answer Zeke's questions.

When I left the library, I stopped by my office to drop off the articles that I had copied.  While I was there, I decided to turn on my computer and look at Zeke's list of questions again, so I could think about them while I drove home.

Now that my first semester classes were over, it was like I had cleared out a big space in my brain.  I couldn't help filling that space with Zeke's questions, which I finally had time to concentrate on.  Even though I was planning to relax for a few days, I wanted to see those questions again.

When I saw the list, the last question, "What did voyageurs look like?", jumped out at me.  It would be easy to answer while I was sitting in my office, where I had a much faster Internet connection than at home.

I searched for voyageurs online, and I was startled to find a lot of people who dress up in voyageur costumes, go to rendevous, and sleep in canvas tents.  They all looked like regular people, and none of them looked like they could carry ninety pounds of furs.

Looking further, I found some romantic old oil paintings of voyageurs battling rapids in the wilderness.  They actually looked pretty normal, too.  In other words, they didn't look like me.  A painting isn't a photograph, and maybe the artist had never seen any real voyageurs.  But now that I thought about it, there was no reason voyageurs should look any different from regular French people, or at least macho and misanthropic French people.

I found a few written descriptions of their appearance.  Some of them said the men were short and stocky, but I didn't find any indication that they were pale or bald.  I looked at pictures of random French people and Quebecers [Quebecois?], and they certainly didn't look bald or pale, either.

I saved one of the voyageur paintings so I could give it to Zeke.  That would answer his question, but it raised a new question.  If Grosvenerians are descended from voyageurs, why don't they -- we -- look like voyageurs?  Maybe it was inbreeding.

This made me think about what Dean had told me in the SUB.  I was curious about that stuff, so I looked up population bottlenecks and Mitochondrial Eve.

I learned that compared to other species, humans are short on genetic diversity.  If you pick two people at random from anywhere in the world, you'll find that about 99.9% of their genes are identical.  Chimpanzees, our closest relatives, are far more diverse.  A few other mammals are known to have a small gene pool, too, and its likely that each of those species passed through its own population bottleneck at some point in the past.  In this age of extinction, a lot of species are passing through bottlenecks right now.  If, for example, California condors come back and have a large population in the future, they'll all be descended from a few individuals, so their genes will be pretty much identical.

I wondered what the world would be like if humans had more genetic diversity.  Would the differences be visible?  Would we be more disease-resistant or less prone to obesity?  It's hard to imagine what the lost lineages were like.

Zeke's questions contained several words that I had never seen before, so I decided to look those words up online while I was at it.  I started with the word "coprolith," which sounded about as strange to me as "nunatak."

The word apparently translates as "shitstone," and it refers to the fossilized remains of very calcium-rich turds.  Hyenas actually eat bones, and their turds have the necessary calcium to form coproliths.  In the past, there have been other species that also ate bones and left coproliths.  Hyenas are related to cats, but there have also been bone-eating dogs, which were bearlike creatures with short faces and extremely strong jaws.

That made me think of what Kieffer had said about Grosvenor dogs.  He said a musher in a race had fed his dogs bones instead of steak or dog food.  What else had he said?  Somebody had tried to breed them with regular dogs, but nothing had happened.  Kieffer had said, "You'll never see a half-Grosvenor dog."

The thoughts that entered my head at this point were too bizarre to believe.  I leaned back in my chair, crossed my arms, and stared vacantly at the computer monitor while I sorted the thoughts out.

A species is, by definition, a population of individuals who breed with each other but not with members of other populations.  There are definitely some grey areas, and it's not always easy to distinguish one species from another.  For example, wolves and domestic dogs can breed but just don't under ordinary circumstances.  And an Irish wolf hound probably couldn't mate with a chihuahua, though they might be attracted to each other and could have puppies through in vitro fertilization.  They'd be comparable to a human couple with fertility problems.  But if individuals from two populations can't or won't breed, then by definition, they're separate species.

It was tempting to think that Grosvenor dogs were a separate species from other dogs.  That could definitely get you published in Nature.  But that would be absurd.  Humans have bred dogs into vastly different shapes and sizes, but they're all still the same species.  And the ability to eat bones would require serious metabolic changes, as well as changes in bone and muscle structure.  I don't know much about evolution or selective breeding, but changes like that would surely take thousands of years.

All I knew was that according to Kieffer, somebody had tried to breed a single Grosvenor dog with a regular dog.  Maybe one of the dogs happened to be sterile or infertile.  And Kieffer had said a musher fed his dogs bones, but that might just be an urban legend, or whatever you call a rumor in the mushing world.  They were probably just big, mean dogs, and nothing more.

I looked up another odd word from Zeke's questions, "Moriori."  I found out that they were, or rather are, the people of the Chatham Islands in the Pacific.  They're closely related to the Maoris, the indigenous people of New Zealand.

The Maoris are Polynesians who used to build oceangoing canoes out of huge trees.  Evidently, on at least one occasion, Maoris got shipwrecked on the Chatham Islands.  Contrary to what you might imagine about Pacific islands, the Chatham Islands are far from the equator.  They're cold, windy, and generally inhospitable.  There are no big trees on the islands, so the castaways were unable to build new canoes.  All they could do was stay there.

There were birds and seals on the islands, and the new residents found that they could eat pretty well, as long as they could get to the various places where the birds and seals lived.  They built wash-through rafts that looked like big bundles of twigs.  The rafts didn't handle very well, but they were unsinkable, which was handy in a windy, rocky place.  They used the rafts to get to the smallest islands and collect bird eggs.  I'm not sure how the eggs survived the trip back.

The castaways adapted and multiplied.  Generations passed, and their language and culture gradually diverged from those of New Zealand.  The words "Maori" and "Moriori" are really the same word in two different dialects.  Both mean "normal people."

In such a small place, the Moriori could easily obliterate a species if they weren't careful.  As a result, they developed a complex system of tapu, or taboos, to regulate hunting.  They could only harvest bird eggs at certain times of the year.  When they killed a seal, they had to carry it away from the beach before processing it, rather than turning the seals' home into a butcher shop.

The most amazing thing about Moriori culture was its prohibition of warfare.  Their existence was just as precarious as that of any other species on the islands, so they had to eliminate warfare in order to survive.  If two people wanted to kill each other, they had to settle for simulated combat with sticks of a very specific size.  It was a lot like fencing.  If one of the combatants bled at all, he would pretend to die, and that was the end of it.

The tapu of the Moriori served them so well that their population density was far greater than that of ordinary hunter-gatherers.  Today, despite the introduction of agriculture and modern technology, the population is much smaller than it used to be.  This is the opposite of just about any other place on Earth.

The Moriori were so isolated that after many generations, it was hard for them to believe that there were any other people or islands in existence.  They believed that their tiny home was the entire world.  It's hard to imagine their astonishment when the first European ship showed up.  They thought the Europeans must have come from the Sun, because they didn't know of any other place they could have come from.

Naturally, other Europeans followed, and they proceeded to slaughter all the seals for their skins and leave the carcasses lying around.  Then a tribe of Maoris arrived to slaughter the people.

Back in New Zealand, which is vastly larger than the Chatham Islands, there were multiple tribes of Maori, and they had no qualms about warfare.  When their population got too big, they solved the problem by killing and eating each other.  The Maori weren't bad people, just normal, as their name implies.  There might have been Maori tribes that weren't good at fighting, but they aren't around anymore.  The ones that survived were experts.

When Europeans showed up, the Maori happily adopted new military technology.  They used cannon and built forts that defied English firepower.  A series of migrations ensued as well-equipped tribes attacked their neighbors and drove them into other people's territory, causing one war after another.

One tribe that was on the losing end of these wars decided to move en masse to the Chatham Islands.  Wouldn't you?  They traded their cannon to an English ship captain in exchange for passage to the islands.  It took two trips to get them all there, even though they packed themselves into the hold so tightly that they were immobilized.  As they crossed this windy part of the Pacific, they puked on each other.

If you wanted to move yourself to a new place, you would buy or rent a place to live.  But if you wanted to move an entire country to a new place, which is essentially what this tribe of Maoris was doing, you'd either have to buy quite a bit of land or go and attack somebody.  The Moriori probably would have made room for them if they had asked -- after all, they had already tolerated Europeans for years.  But in Maori culture, the usual method of acquiring land was to attack the inhabitants, eat the dead, and enslave anyone who didn't get away.  The Maori tribe knew this custom well, since they had been on the receiving end of it themselves.  Once they had recovered from their trip, they set about killing, eating, and enslaving people as a procedural matter, to establish title to the land.

After their society had been destroyed, the shell-shocked Moriori acquired a reputation for being lazy and stupid.  They eventually assimilated with their captors, which led people to believe that they were extinct or even mythical.  People were so clueless about who the Moriori were that their name was applied to a totally different group.  Throughout the twentieth century, most New Zealanders believed that the Moriori were an inferior race of people who lived in New Zealand, not the Chatham Islands, before the Maoris arrived.  A lot of people still believe something along those lines, if they haven't read a book on the subject or visited the national museum.

I didn't learn all this that day in my office, but I got the general idea.  I next looked up Coats Island, which turned out to be another place where an isolated group of people lived.

Coats Island is in northern Canada.  Unlike the Chatham Islands, it's close to other land, so its inhabitants weren't trapped in the middle of an ocean.  They were the last remnants of a culture that had once covered a huge area.  When outsiders first encountered them, their culture was familiar to archeologists but thought to be dead.

There seemed to be a theme to some of these questions.  A similar but more understandable question from Zeke's list was, "Where were New England's Native Americans in the nineteenth century?"  I looked through one of the books I had just checked out, which I had chosen because I thought it might answer the question.

I had thought that New England's Native Americans were dead.  In Arizona, there are big reservations all over the place, and Native Americans are quite visible both on and off the reservations.  In New England, there didn't seem to be any reservations, though I've since learned that there are a few, and Native American culture appears to be represented more by place names than by people.

The answer to Zeke's question was that they were underground.  They didn't all die.  Some of them went to Canada, but mostly they just blended in.  They pretended to be European.  It allowed them to survive, though it led to legal problems later, when they started trying to assert their rights.  People have accused New England's modern Native Americans of abandoning their inheritance and giving up any sovereignty they might have had.

When Native Americans were incognito, they often pretended to be French.  One of the many strange things about this part of the country is that the French language, which is usually associated with high culture and refined taste, is here associated with white trash.  In mill towns, the ones with water power and lots of factories, many of the poor factory workers were French Canadian.  Since affluent white people can't tell the difference between one oppressed minority and another, the disguise was easy to pull off.

Was Zeke trying to tell me that we Grosvenerians were really Native Americans?  Was that why my mother was a racist -- was she an Indian in denial?  That seemed to be where this was going, except for the blatant fact that we look even less like Native Americans than voyageurs.  I've never seen a bald Indian, and they're certainly not noted for being pale or short.  Maybe we were really English people pretending to be Native Americans pretending to be French Canadian.  It might explain why the town had a weird English name.  But unless Grosvenor was a colony of fugitives or pirates, it's hard to imagine a reason for such absurdity.

Where did the name come from, anyway?  I tried looking it up online without success.  I got up and headed down the hall to the Bureau library.

When I got up from my computer, I realized that I had been there for quite a long time.  It was dark, my bladder was full, I was hungry, and I was decidedly not sticking to my plan of relaxing, but I was on a mission.  I took a detour upstairs, peed, got some cookies from a vending machine, and headed down to the library.

In the library, I found a book of Maine place names.  The entry for Grosvenor was really odd.  It said the town had once been called Grosvenor's Fence, but no one knew of any Grosvenors or fences of note in the town.  The name was thought to be a transliteration of an old Indian name.  However, people couldn't agree on what it might have meant or even which language it came from.  By all accounts, the place had just always been called that.

At this point, I was ready to go home.

When I got home, the house was frigid.  I checked the thermostat, wondering if Eleanore had accidentally turned it off when she meant to turn it up that morning.  It was on and set high.  I carefully felt one of the heat exchangers that ran along the baseboards.  It was cold.  Clearly, the heating system wasn't working.

Our boiler lived in a little closet between the bathroom and the kitchen.  Outside the door was a red switch, like a light switch, that turned it on and off.  The switch was on.  I opened the closet to see if anything looked strange in there, but I had no idea what to look for.

My house in Arizona had central air conditioning and a swamp cooler.  The air conditioner could double as a heater in the winter, but heating was never really a priority.  This house in Gabbro Falls had no air conditioning and no swamp cooler.  It had a big tank outside that was full of oil.  It was completely mysterious to me.

I wasn't sure what the boiler should be doing, but it seemed like even a broken boiler would do something, like buzz or light up, even if it wasn't producing heat.  This one was dark and silent.  Looking closely, I saw a couple LEDs that were dark.  That made me think it wasn't getting power.

I flipped the switch a couple times, but nothing happened.  I went to the house electrical panel, which was also in the hall.  Here, at least, was something familiar.  When I opened the panel, I was delighted to see a breaker that had tripped.  I reset it, and the boiler clicked and roared.  Very pleased with myself, I smugly closed the panel and the boiler closet.

I ate something and then decided to go to bed early and read.  I got into bed with Colin Tudge's The Time Before History, the same book where I got the quote at the beginning of this book.  I soon fell asleep.

The next thing I remember is terror.  Something was attacking me.  I didn't know what it was or where I was or who I was.  All I knew was that I was in mortal danger, and I desperately tried to fight whatever it was.  I heard a sharp scream that wasn't mine and wasn't my attacker's.

I fought off the thing that was attacking me, and then I was fighting something else.  I was entwined with it.  Just as I vanquished this second monster, a fog lifted, and I realized I was in bed.  I had just thrown and kicked my blankets off the bunkbed.

It was daytime.  Eleanore's girlfriend was standing in my doorway.  She was wearing a coat, hat, and mittens, and she was white.  She looked terrified, and she was looking at me.

I heard a noise from below the bed, and I leaned over the edge and looked down.  Eleanore was on her hands and knees.  She was wearing her coat, too.  She was breathing heavily and kind of wheezing.  She sat up, put a gloved hand on her throat, and looked up at me warily.  "Jesus Christ!" she said huskily.  "You scared the shit out of me.  I thought you were dead, and then I thought you were gonna kick the shit out of me."

I sat up and hung my feet off the bed, not sure if I should be embarassed or frightened.  My heart was pounding.  In an effort to orient myself, I looked at the clock.  It was 3:07.  Three o'clock and sunlight meant afternoon.  I asked, "Did something just happen?"

Eleanore spoke rapidly.  "I come home and the house is fuckin' freezing, and you're lying there all pale and shit.  It's like you weren't even breathing.  I tried waking you up, and you punched me.  You punched me in the throat and knocked me over.  You weren't even awake yet.  How can you sleep when it's so fucking cold?  I thought you'd frozen to death.  It fuckin' creeped me out."

I looked at Kaia, the girlfriend, but she didn't say anything.  She hadn't moved since I had woken up.

"I guess I overslept," I said.

Eleanore asked incredulously, "Aren't you cold?"

I looked down at myself.  I was only wearing boxer shorts and a T-shirt.  Now that she mentioned it, it was pretty chilly in the room, but I hadn't previously noticed.  "Yeah, I guess I am," I said, but mainly I just felt embarassed about the fact that two women, one of whom I barely knew, were staring at me while I sat in bed in my boxer shorts.

I climbed down, picked up a dirty pair of pants off the floor, and put them on.  The pants felt very cold.  I found a fleece jacket on the bottom bunk and put it on, too.

Eleanore asked, "What happened to the heat?"

"I think I turned it down when I got home last night.  You had turned it way up."

"It's still way up.  It's not working.  There's no heat in the house."

Strictly speaking, it's impossible for a house to contain no heat, but I didn't make an issue of it.  I said, "Oh, the breaker must have tripped again.  I'll reset it."

I walked over to the door, which was occupied by Kaia.  Kaia looked newly startled and got out of the way.  She had forgotten that she was actually in the room and not just watching all this on TV or something.  I went out to the breaker panel and opened it.  Kaia and Eleanore were still in my room.  I shouted, "It's number six.  You just have to turn it off and back on."  I reset the breaker and heard the boiler click and roar.

The crinkly plastic that covered the floor was cold on my feet.  I decided to go get some socks.  I went back to my room, where Eleanore and Kaia both stared at me again.  I had the feeling they'd been having a hushed conversation about me.

Trying to make normal conversation, I said, "What are you guys up to today?  I didn't think I'd see you 'til tomorrow or Monday."

Eleanore raised one eyebrow.  "Tomorrow is Monday."

I smiled and then knelt over a trunk where I kept my clean clothes.  "Has your weekend of bliss made you lose track of time?  It's still only Saturday.  You've got another day together."

I got a pair of socks, stood up, and turned to face them.  They were giving each other that look that people share when they're dealing with an insane person.  Neither of them said anything.  They seemed to be communicating with their eyebrows.  They clearly had no doubt that it was Sunday and I was out of my gourd.

Eleanore pulled out her phone and touched the screen.

I laughed and asked, "What, are you going to call somebody and ask?  You don't believe me?"

Eleanore turned the phone toward me.  It showed the time, the date, and the abbreviation "SUN".

I took the phone from her and looked at it more closely, in case I had misread it.  Sure enough, it said it was Sunday.  I was briefly shocked, but then it occurred to me that they were taking advantage of the phone company's error to play a joke on me.  "That's pretty funny," I said.  "Has it said that all day?"

"What the fuck?" yelled Eleanore.  "Yeah, it has said all day that it's today.  You don't believe it?"

I laughed again.  "I think you guys are shitting me.  You must have known the phone's date was off."

"Come here!"  Eleanore grabbed my arm and marched me down the crinkly hall to her room, which also had crinkly plastic on the floor.  She tapped rapidly on her phone, then shoved it at me.  She had pulled up a Web page with a schedule of radio shows on the Maine Public Broadcast Network.

"It's 3:10," she said.  "What's on at 3:10 on Saturday?"

I studied the schedule.  "Um, opera."

Eleanore turned her radio on.  A very hip guy was explaining the influence that Jelly Roll Morton has had on American music.  I looked at the schedule again.  On Sunday, there was a show called American Routes.

Eleanore said, "Oh yeah, in Maine we have the annual Two-Sunday Weekend.  Everybody pretends it's Sunday when it's really Saturday.  Even the phone company."

It sounded absurd, but I hoped it was true.  "Really?" I asked.

"No, you moron, you were in a fucking coma on Saturday!"

In a last-ditch effort at disbelief, I wondered if Eleanore and Kaia had reset the clocks, though I wasn't sure if it would explain anything.  Maybe it was really early Saturday morning.  I went to Eleanore's window and looked at the sun.  I wasn't exactly sure where it should be at 3:10 in December, but it appeared to be in the right neighborhood.  It was definitely afternoon.  I looked at the radio schedule again.  They had opera all afternoon on Saturdays.

"Wow," I said.  I turned around and stared dumbly at the schedule on Eleanore's phone.  I could feel cold air from the window on the back of my head.

Today was undeniably Sunday, and the last thing I remembered was coming home on Friday night.  I tried hard to remember Saturday.  Had I been drinking?  Did I do something yesterday that made me forget the whole day?  Nothing short of a head injury could cause that to happen.  Even if I had spent the whole day piss drunk, which was unlikely, I would at least remember getting out of bed on Saturday morning.

Eleanore, who was calmer now that I wasn't disputing her claim, said, "You need to go to the hospital.  Maybe you had hypothermia or something."

Coming from Arizona, I didn't know much about hypothermia.  However, I was pretty sure that sleeping all day wasn't one of the symptoms.  In a non-confrontational way, still trying to think, I said, "I think I'd be dead by now if I had hypothermia."

"Well, yeah, but... I dunno.  Maybe you had a stroke.  You should definitely have somebody check it out, anyway.  That's just not normal."

"You're right, it's not," I said.  Zeke's questions flashed through my head.  Grosvenor, the Moriori, Coats Island, New England's Native American underground, and even the coproliths all fit together.  I didn't know if we Grosvenerians and our dogs were English or Native American or what, but we definitely weren't normal.

Half stupefied, I looked at Eleanore and said, "Those were my genes."

Eleanore immediately looked wary again.  Slowly, she asked, "Did someone borrow your clothes?"

I shook my head.  "The mitochondria!  The first time, Colleen swabbed me herself.  The second time, Frances did it.  Frances..."  I thought for a few seconds.  "I never saw Frances get swabbed at the party.  Holy shit!  We're fucking mutants or something."

"Ian, this isn't about that.  This is serious."

"You're fucking right it's serious.  Holy shit!  Do you know what a population bottleneck is?  Do you know how much more diverse chimps are than humans?"

Now she was exasperated.  "What in God's name does chimp diversity have to do with sleeping in a cold house for a day and a half?"

"I need to go find some stuff out," I said.  I started to leave and found that Kaia was, once again, standing dumbstruck in the doorway.  She jumped out of my way as I left the room.  "Sorry to freak you out," I said.  I hoped she knew I was sincere.
