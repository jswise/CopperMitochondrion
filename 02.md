# Chapter 2

On my first day in Gabbro Falls, Puppet House became my new home. I needed to find a place to live quickly, preferably someplace where I could move in immediately. I think I forgot to mention that I arrived on campus about a day and a half earlier than I had planned, because along the way I slept significantly less than one might expect. I might have been able to get a dorm room on short notice, but the dorms weren't going to open until a couple days later.

Mines never came up with a name for their student union building, so they just call it the Student Union Building, or the SUB. I guess nobody donated enough money to have it named after them, and the name "Memorial," the old standby of college buildings, was already taken by a dorm.

On the morning after I arrived, only two buildings on campus were unlocked, the SUB and the computer center. Although school hadn't started yet, there were twenty or thirty undergrads busily typing away in the computer center. I thought they seemed remarkably diligent, even for engineering students, but I later learned that the undergrads at Mines had a symbiotic relationship with computers. They weren't writing term papers, as I assumed – they were just engaged in forms of entertainment that only a computer science major can comprehend.

Oh yes, I was telling you about Puppet House. In the SUB, the other building that was open that day, there was a bulletin board. On the bulletin board were several computer-printed "Housemate Wanted" signs that were elaborately and tastelessly embellished with wavy lettering and full-color fonts, all of which were clearly designed by computer geeks. One sign was different -- it was hand-written on paper that appeared to be made of chopped-up newspaper and dryer lint. It read, "HOUSEMATE WANTED to share a house with two humans, two cats, and many puppets. Storage shed & lake access. Artist preferred." The bottom had been cut into vertical strips with a phone number on them, and nobody had taken any of the strips. Naturally, I called the number immediately. I wouldn't call myself an artist, but I thought perhaps I could convince them that I was mildly interesting anyway.

The woman who answered the phone sounded very serious and very unlike someone who would be living with puppets. In the most businesslike tone, she directed me to a place on the other side of Gabbro Lake, which is next to the town.

The house sat on a dirt road in the woods, and it looked like it had originally been built as a summer cottage and then gradually enclosed. In the driveway was a blue Datsun 210 that was even more venerable than my car and had an unobtrusive rainbow sticker on the back. The back yard went right down to Gabbro Lake, and I could see a canoe and a kayak sitting on an old, wooden dock. It looked fantastic.

The woman who answered the door was only slightly taller than I was, which is to say she was quite short. She had bright green hair that was about a quarter inch long. Her head looked remarkably like a tennis ball. She had three small, identical, silver rings in her ears and nose, and she was wearing blue overalls and an orange T-shirt. Her face looked as serious as her voice had sounded on the phone, which made me wonder if she had simply forgotten that she had green hair and an orange shirt. Then she gave me a smile that was small but warm.

"Hi," she said, "are you the one who called?"

"Yeah, I'm Ian Dawson."

I held out my hand, and she shook it like a man. "Eleanore Crane, C-R-A-N-E. Come on inside." I didn't know why she had spelled her name out, but I learned later that she did that every time she said it.

I should mention at this point that when I had read the ad, I had pictured two mildly eccentric students who perhaps had more stuffed animals than average but were otherwise normal. Instead, what I found was arresting. I feel quite confident in saying that you have never seen a house like Puppet House.

The front room was a former porch that had been enclosed. The wood floor looked like a Jackson Pollack painting, except that it was textured with random globs of papier-mâché. Obscuring most of the floor was a pile of masks, sawdust, buckets, tools, wooden stakes, coils of wire two feet in diameter, and overstuffed garbage bags with brightly colored taffeta spilling out of them. At one end of the porch were three large, cardboard barrels that were overflowing with scraps of foam rubber in various hues of beige, brown, and green. At the other end were several large, black objects that I later determined were the disassembled parts of a papier-mâché businessman who was four meters tall and looked like a cross between Newt Gingrich and Satan.

Eleanor stepped over a mannequin leg and opened another door. "Do you know Kieffer Andersen?" she asked.

"No. Um, I just arrived here." I was so distracted by the menagerie that I barely looked at her.

"Oh, are you a freshman?"

"No, I'm a graduate student."

"Oh, that's good." She stepped through the doorway and onto a noisy sheet of plastic. "Kieffer is a puppeteer. He and another guy, Ashton Sheffield, do a lot of puppet stuff. Their main workshop is out in the boathouse, but they don't have enough room out there for everything."

I followed her through the door, and I saw that the entire living room floor was covered with plastic sheeting. The plastic was transparent but foggy, and I could faintly see red and orange carpeting under it. Strips of duct tape covered the seams between the sheets of plastic, and another strip of tape went around the perimeter of the room to seal the edges of the plastic against the moulding.

This room had furniture –- a dentist's chair with a little sink next to it; a hair drying chair; a bowling alley table with two attached chairs, bottle holders, and a built-in opaque projector; and a bench that had a sort of easel built onto one end. The easel was solid, like a drafting table, and a charcoal drawing of six disembodied but very realistic hands was stuck to it with masking tape. A dollar bill about a meter and a half long, made of papier-mâché and chicken wire, leaned against a wall behind the dentist's chair.

On the walls were several paintings that appeared to have been painted on used, four-by-eight-foot dropcloths. One of them had several overlapping silhouettes that were remarkably precise, as if they had been traced from somebody's shadow. The other one was a sort of collage of houses with a great deal of writing on it. I'm no art critic, and I can barely even describe what the paintings looked like, but I can tell you that I immediately liked them.

"This is the living room, and back here is the kitchen." She had the nonchalant air of a realtor showing a totally unremarkable house.

I followed her into the kitchen, which had originally been decorated in the fisherman's cabin style. Everything was made of varnished wood – even the countertop was wood – and the cupboards had black hinges and handles that were supposed to look like wrought iron. The built-in décor was overlaid with decorations in the maniacal puppet style, which included papier-mâché flowers that looked like they were from a stage production of "Little Shop of Horrors." On the fridge was a magnet that looked like Michelangelo's David, and he had little magnetic clothes that you could stick on him.

She stepped back out of the kitchen and went down a hallway with a plastic-and-carpet floor. "Back here is the empty room," she said. I thought at first that she was referring to some kind of sensory deprivation chamber or installation piece, but then I realized that she was talking about my prospective bedroom. We passed a bathroom that contained a standing, life-size diagram of a person with transparent overlays to show the various organs.

The bedroom turned out to have the same sort of varnished wood paneling as the kitchen. It went one step further in the fishing lodge motif, though, because it had a built-in bunkbed that was also, naturally, made of varnished wood. The room had been cleaned out and vacuumed, and its absolute emptiness in the middle of this house did make it seem a bit like an art project. There was no plastic to hide the glory of the red and orange shag, and the only item in the room that wasn't built in was a small shelf inside a shallow closet. I learned later that the shelf was made out of a dismantled shipping palette.

"This is great," I said. "Do I need to fill out an application or something?"

She cocked one eyebrow as if I'd made an odd suggestion. "No," she said slowly, "you can just move in if you want. You don't seem too scary." I decided to take this as a compliment.

Since all of my possessions fit in a Tercel, it didn't take long to move in. I wasn't sure what to do with the extra bunk, so I tossed my snowboard and some other large items on top for storage. Then I decided I'd rather sleep on the top bunk, so I pulled the stuff back down. True to the spirit of 1970s built-ins, the bottom bunk turned out to have a storage bin under the mattress. After putting all my winter stuff in there, I sat on the bottom bunk to see if it would make a nice couch.

I snagged my hair on the springs that held the top bunk. Bunk beds just aren't much good for anything other than sleeping.

Eleanore had to go do something in her art studio on campus, so I got to spend some time alone with Puppet House. I was afraid to go into any rooms, because it felt too much like I was invading someone's privacy. I was also afraid I might find a sleeping person that Eleanore hadn't mentioned.

I went outside and gingerly stepped onto the squeaking dock. I looked at the lake, which was surrounded by forest and a few other docks like this one. Some of the docks had pontoon boats tied to them, and there were canoes lying on the shore. Through the trees behind a couple of the docks, I could glimpse other little houses. It was so utterly unlike the Arizona desert that it really felt exotic to me. Here's a place where water and trees are normal, I thought, where it probably never gets over a hundred degrees Fahrenheit. Here's my new home. It felt good to be in a place that was friendly and mysterious at the same time. Sometime soon, I thought, I'll find out what's around the lake. Maybe I'll learn to use this kayak. I like it here.

Later, as I was trying to balance my computer on the little shelf made of palette wood, I heard a vehicle that was so unashamed of its bodily noises that it surely had no muffler. I couldn't see it –- my window faced the lake –- but I heard it park out front. I thought about going out to the living room to greet the driver, but I was afraid I might scare whoever it was. I decided to just stay in my little room and wait for them to come to me.

I heard the front door and then heavy steps on the enclosed porch. I heard the crinkling plastic in the living room, then silence, then the refrigerator door. Then I heard what sounded like a really loud machine starting up. I mentally went through the list of loud machinery that one might use in a kitchen –- espresso machine, blender, vacuum cleaner –- but couldn't find a match. Then I heard the sound of a chopsaw cutting through steel, only it wasn't quite as loud as a chopsaw would be if it were in the kitchen. Then the rhythm of the thing changed, and I realized that it was music. My mystery housemate had turned on a stereo to play some percussion-and-chopsaw music.

A voice that was low, masculine, and frightening uttered a single word: "Goddammit!" The refrigerator door slammed, and I heard the person open a can of pop. A second later, I heard the crinkle of the hallway plastic. My mysterious and apparently large housemate approached. I reminded myself that I had not touched the refrigerator, so I was probably not the object of his wrath.

I suddenly noticed that I was sitting on the floor and doing nothing, because I had long ago been distracted from my computer balancing project. I didn't want to look like I was catatonic or listening intently to my housemate's every move, although of course I was, so I picked up the monitor again and pretended to see if it would fit on the shelf.

I had been correct in assuming that he was large. You might say he was even scary-looking, although it would depend on your point of view. He was well over six feet tall, and a great deal of his red hair went even higher. His eyes opened a little too wide, making him look simultaneously startled and haunted. Well, perhaps "maniacal" would be a more appropriate word. In his hand was a bright green aluminum can.

"Are you living here?" he asked.

I nearly dropped the monitor when I stood up. "Yeah! Um, I just moved in. I'm Ian." I reached out to shake his hand, wondering if it would hurt.

He passed the green can to his other hand, and I noticed that it said "LIME." Where on Earth does one find lime pop?

"Kieffer," he said. "Welcome." Although his hand was large, his handshake was quite painless. He apparently didn't blame me for anything, because he was friendly.

He looked around at my possessions. "Did you just come today?"

"Yep. I just got into town last night, and I slept in my car on campus. I found your ad in the union."

"The Union? Is that a newspaper?"

"No, um, the student union building."

"Oh, the SUB. Yeah, Eleanore put that up."

"Ah." I nodded, then looked around at my possessions as he had done, even though I'd already seen all of them.

"So, are you a freshman?" he asked.

"Uh, graduate student."

"Really? Those are rare. Are you a geologist?"

"Yep. I'm studying economic geology."

"Huh."

"What about you?"

"I'm taking time off. I was majoring in physics, and now I'm thinking maybe I should major in philosophy. There's no philosophy program at Mines, though, so I'm not sure."

"So, are you going to go to a different school?"

"I dunno. I haven't really decided yet."

"I see."

"Well, anyway, feel free to put your dishes in the kitchen or whatever. I'll be down the hall if you need anything."

"Thanks."

Over the next couple days, I got to like my housemates pretty well. They were both very friendly, even if neither one of them expressed it in the usual way. Eleanor's face had a default expression that looked very serious and thoughtful, even if she was just eating breakfast. She looked even more serious when she was drawing, which she did often on the combination bench and easel in the living room.

I found out that the disembodied hands in the drawing that I had seen on the first day were actually all pictures of her own left hand, which she had drawn for lack of a model. She would do studies of a particular object, often a body part, just to make sure she could draw it. She also spent a lot of time painting pictures in her studio on campus.

Kieffer's maniacal face was a pretty accurate expression of what was going on in his head, which was entirely harmless. He had some weird ideas about physics, and his philosophical ideas were rooted in ecoterrorism. The equations and environmental angst somehow converged into ideas for puppet shows.

I met one of the cats and caught glimpses of the other. The cat I met was named Grape, because he was black with an oddly purplish hue. He was also overweight and kind of spherical, which suited his name well. The strangest thing about Grape was that he had opposable thumbs, or at least he was closer to having thumbs than most cats. He could open cupboards with his paws. Rather than displaying his talents, though, he mostly just sat like a blob directly in front of anyone who sat still. The other cat was named Sasquatch, because he appeared so rarely that it was hard to tell if he really existed.

Ashton, Kieffer's partner in puppeteering, was unique. He rarely spoke, but when he did speak it was with conviction. He had a quiet, high voice that made him sound perpetually apologetic, yet there was nothing apologetic about his thoughts or his words. The day I met him, Kieffer confronted him about a pomegranate that had disappeared from the fridge. This had been the cause of Kieffer's expletive just before I met him. Ashton said, with his usual fierce yet soft-voiced conviction, "Food should be community property." Kieffer said that if Ashton were to go out and buy some food, he was welcome to declare it community property. But if Kieffer buys a pomegranate and then spends a whole day thinking about how good it's going to taste when he gets home, then it is not community property.

I never determined why anyone would buy or eat a pomegranate –- I had only seen them in Salvador Dali paintings –- but it wasn't my pomegranate to worry about. And Kieffer and Ashton didn't worry about it too much after sharing their differing philosophies about community property. They were best friends, and their puppet work never slowed.
