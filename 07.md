# Chapter 7

During the first few months of school, I thought about nothing but classes and glaciers. I signed up for Practicum in C++ alongside my grueling economic geology classes, and I spent a lot of time reading about glaciology. I drilled through the two books that Hank had given me, and then I started reading articles in scientific journals about the latest ideas in the field, particularly about the physics of glacial movement.

I found out that the big file cabinet in Hank's office was stuffed with photocopies of journal articles. He kept an undergraduate intern busy photocopying every article that he found interesting. He encouraged me to start my own collection of copies, but I thought his habit was eccentric, not to mention a violation of copyright laws.

I didn't make any special effort to find the answers to Zeke's questions, partly because I just didn't want to think about him, but I happened to come across some of the answers in my reading. What I learned about glacial advances and retreats was downright frightening. You might think I'm neurotic for saying that I'm afraid of glaciers, but let me explain.

Nonscientists tend to think that there was a period a long time ago called The Ice Age, when Earth was crawling with wooly mammoths, sabretooth tigers, ice sheets, and slow-witted humans with clubs and furs. Most people couldn't tell you when this period was, except that it was sometime after the dinosaurs died and a long time before now. Although this view is partly accurate, it diverges from reality, or at least from the current consensus among scientists, in several important ways. The most important difference is that what most people think of as prehistory is, in fact, still happening.

During the four and a half billion years of Earth's existence, there have been several long, icy periods called "glacial ages." Within each cold spell are warm spikes, when the ice briefly recedes but things don't warm up entirely. When the glacial age ends, the ice disappears altogether. Right now, we're in a cold spell that has been going on for about a million years, though we happen to live in one of the warm spikes. One way you can tell we're still in a glacial age is that we still have polar ice caps, which are kind of a rarity in Earth's history. It's colder now than it was when the dinosaurs were around, and if humans weren't modifying the climate, the glaciers would probably advance again before the ice caps melt and we go back to a climate that a brontosaurus would find comfortable. For this reason, our warm spike is called an "interglacial period," and it's worth noting that nobody calls it "postglacial."

The glacial advances, or glaciations, last a lot longer than the warm spikes, or interglacial periods. In a typical cycle, you'll see about ninety thousand years of ice and only ten thousand years of warmth. So right now it's abnormally warm if you look at the past million years, even though it's abnormally cold compared to most of Earth's history.

No one knows what causes the ice to come and go, but it's probably a combination of a lot of different things. Oceans open and close as the continents move, causing changes in circulation. When North and South America got together and cut the Atlantic off from the Pacific, it might have profoundly changed the world's climate. When the Himalayas rose, more rock started weathering, which removed carbon dioxide from the air and cooled things off. The tilt of Earth's axis changes, and the direction that the axis points changes. In other words, Polaris isn't always above the North Pole, because Earth wobbles like a top. There are also solar cycles and perhaps even galactic cycles. All these factors overlap, and we'll probably never know how many factors there are.

In our interglacial period, the temperature peaked about six thousand years ago. There have been some ups and downs since then, but the general trend was downard until recently. If people weren't causing the planet to warm up again, you could say with certainty that we're well on our way to the next glaciation. But since the global warming that we're causing now is unprecedented, no one can say what the effect will be. It could cause our glacial age to end, meaning that the ice would disappear and not come back, or it could cause changes in ocean circulation that would, surprisingly, hasten the end of our interglacial and the return of the ice.

The really scary part is the speed with which the climate can change. It may be that the climate has certain states that it likes to be in, like a marble on a Chinese checkerboard, and it stays in one state until it gets pushed far enough to jump to another. Chaos theorists call states like that "strange attractors." There's a lot of evidence to suggest that the jump could happen rapidly, i.e. within one person's lifetime. So while we worry about the global temperature going up a degree or the ocean rising a millimeter at a time, we could actually be headed for a much more drastic change in either direction.

By the way, the term "ice age" makes scientists uncomfortable, because it's not specific enough. You can get away with referring to the most recent glaciation as "the last ice age," but if you just say "The Ice Age," then you're talking about a fictional time when cartoon characters roamed the planet. The term could also mean the present, since we're still in a glacial age.

It's true that wooly mammoths, sabretooth tigers, and people with furs were at large during the last glaciation, but those fur-clad people were genetically modern. In other words, they were indistinguishable from ourselves. They had tools, religion, and art, and they probably would have scoffed at the idea of carrying a club. The dinosaurs had been gone for a long time, and we mammals had been evolving for quite a while.

You might say that mammoths are our contemporaries. They aren't walking around today, but that's equally true of passenger pigeons and Ronald Reagan. Mammoths were around for most of human history, and they died recently enough that their frozen bodies still turn up in Siberia. A few people in the twentieth century sampled mammoth steaks. There's even evidence to suggest that an Egyptian pharoah received a dwarf mammoth as a gift. Mammoths and elephants have an odd ability to evolve into smaller sizes when they live on islands, and dwarf mammoths survived on islands off the coast of Siberia for quite a while. It's possible, but very unlikely, that mammoths still live today in remote parts of Siberia. It's a big place.

While I was learning this stuff, I often talked about the project with Eleanore, even though she knew little about geology. I would sit in the dental chair and talk while Grape plopped on the floor and purred and Eleanore sat on her easel bench and drew pictures. Sometimes she even drew pictures of me. I made a good model, because I was too busy ranting about glaciers to be self-conscious.

At first, I was very careful about not looking over Eleanore's shoulder while she drew, and I wasn't sure if I should even be in the same room with her. Then she explained that she really enjoyed watching other artists work, and she enjoyed having people watch her, as well. I guess she was kind of an exhibitionist that way. She also said that whenever she went to museums, she would get close to the paintings and try to figure out how the artists had painted the pictures. She often found places where they had changed their minds and painted over stuff.

Eleanore had a remarkably analytical mind for an artist, and she told me that she had almost majored in chemistry instead of art. She actually enjoyed hearing my convoluted explanations of what I was doing. I think she was living vicariously, finding out what it would have been like to be a scientist instead of an artist.

When Eleanore spoke, it was usually to ask an insightful question. Sometimes her questions were about things I hadn't really thought about, and sometimes they kept me up at night. Sometimes her questions even sent me back to my freshman geology book to look up things that I had always taken for granted.

One night, after I came home from the library at eleven o'clock and sat down at the bowling table to eat some ramen, we got on the subject of kettle lakes. As every freshman geology student knows, kettle lakes form when glaciers retreat and leave chunks of ice behind, like landlocked icebergs. When one of the chunks melts, you get a hole full of water. To my surprise, Eleanore didn't buy this explanation.

Without looking up from her drawing -- I believe it was a drawing of Ashton's unicycle, which was propped up against the hairdrying chair -- she said, "But glaciers don't really retreat, do they?"

"Sure!" I said. "I mean, otherwise they'd still be here."

She gave me a reproachful look for a split second, while her hand kept moving. Then, with her eyes on the unicycle, she said, "I know they melt, but they don't move backward. They keep moving forward, and they melt faster than they advance, right?"

"Yeah."

"So it's not like a piece would break off and get left behind. And even if it did, it would have to be crammed down into the mud to make a hole. 'Cause if it didn't, it would melt and just leave flat ground like everywhere else."

I got really flustered at this point, and I retrieved my old introductory geology textbook. Just for fun, I used the bowling table's opaque projector to project an image of the page onto the wall and the ceiling, even though the image was so distorted that Eleanore couldn't make anything of it when she paused to look up. The book basically said the same thing I had said, which was the same thing my old professor had said, which I now realized made no sense at all. Eleanore was right, and I had just never thought about it critically before. I told her I'd look into it, and she had me tip the bowling table forward and project an illustration of a granitic intrusion onto the unicycle to make her drawing more abstract.

It wasn't until I reread the advanced textbook I'd borrowed from Hank, the thin one with hardly any illustrations, that I found out how kettle lakes really form. You start with a thick layer of really dirty ice that has stopped moving and started to melt. Some parts melt faster than others, so the surface gets lumpy. The parts where the ice melts the slowest remain higher than the rest. After a while, you get hills, complete with dirt and trees and mastodons, but the foundations of the hills are made of ice instead of rock. As the hills erode, the sediment flows to the low spots, where the ice melted first. Now the hills are getting shorter while the low spots are getting higher. When the ice all finally melts, the hills turn into depressions, and that's how kettle lakes form. You could say that a chunk of ice got left behind, but it's a drastic oversimplification.

I gave Eleanore the new explanation at a party. We were both drunk, and there were frequent interruptions, so it took a long time. She had no trouble understanding it, though, and this time she was satisfied.

Unlike Eleanore, whom I mostly saw late at night, Kieffer was an early riser. By the time I got out of bed, he and Ashton were usually down at the boathouse making puppets. As it got colder, their activities migrated to the enclosed porch, and their work often spilled into the living room.

I'm a different person in the morning. I know a lot of people say they're not morning people, but for me it's extreme. Until I take a shower, I'm a grouchy zombie. It's like I'm not fully awake until the hot water hits me. One morning, I stumbled through the living room like Godzilla, stepping in glue and kicking puppets while Kieffer and Ashton scrambled to remove things from my path. When Kieffer mentioned the event later, he seemed to remember a lot more details than I did. I couldn't even remember what he had said to me.

Fortunately, the Godzilla Incident didn't seem to bother Kieffer much, and we coexisted pretty well. I made sure I didn't eat any of his food, and I usually went straight from my bed to the shower to avoid destroying anything.

The only friction with Eleanore was over the temperature of the house. Kieffer and I both liked it cold, [clarify]

and he often left windows and even doors open when it was forty degrees Fahrenheit. Sometimes he'd even leave the house early in the morning and not bother to close the door. Eleanore, on the other hand, always wanted the house to be warm and cozy.

I was used to Arizona, where it's hot outside and cold inside. When my mother was alive, she always kept the air conditioner at full power. I must have gotten used to it, because I always sleep best in a cold room.

At Puppet House, we compromised by keeping the house cold at night and warm in the daytime. We convinced Eleanore that she could always put more blankets on her bed if she was cold, and we convinced Kieffer that he could always go outside if he got too hot during the day. It was perfect for me, because I'm just as happy as the next person to be warm when I'm awake.
