# The Copper Mitochondrion (a novel)

A graduate student discovers that some of his ancestors didn't come to North America in the usual ways. As he learns about his newfound clan, his thesis project threatens them with cultural extinction. To save his people, he must manage his sketchy thesis advisor, his inbred relatives and their scary dogs, and his own scientific credibility.

After working on this project for many years, I decided to post it online and see if anyone wants to read it or improve it. Reading [Jessica Abel](https://jessicaabel.com/how-to-finish-major-project/) inspired me to call it done, or at least ready for editing, and stop trying to perfect it.

There may be some problems with the chronology of the chapters. Some parts, especially in Chapter 12, might put you to sleep. The novel is set in an ambiguous time, because I worked on it intermittently from 2001 to 2018. The characters drive Datsuns and may or may not use cell phones.
