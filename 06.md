# Chapter 6

On the Monday after Zeke sent me his list of questions, I went up the creaky stairs of the Jackson Building to see Hank. As always, he didn't mind if I showed up unannounced. I sat down and said, "Zeke Gray wants to be on my committee. Tom seems to think it's a good idea."

Hank grinned, chuckled a little, and shook his head. "I knew that old bugger'd wanna get a piece of this."

"What's..." I wasn't sure what to ask. "What's up with him?"

"Did'ja talk to him?"

"Yeah. He was kind of freaky. I have no idea why he's interested in my thesis."

Hank laughed. "He prob'ly suspects we're getting into his territory."

"What, sedimentary geology?"

Hank laughed harder. "No, Grosvenor!"

I was getting really sick of hearing that word. "What does Grosvenor have to do with anything?"

"Close the door."

That was a shock. Usually, if a student and a professor meet behind closed doors, it means the student is either failing or having an affair with the professor. It was surely too early for me to be in any kind of academic trouble, and I didn't even want to think about the second possibility. But I couldn't imagine what was secret about Grosvenor.

As I got up to shut the door, Hank pulled a desk drawer all the way open and reached into the back of it. I wondered if we were about to share some bourbon. When the door was closed, he pulled out a sample bottle about the size of a baby food jar. It was made of a brand of translucent, white plastic called Nalgene, and it was very ordinary. A typical lab is littered with bottles like this one. But they're not usually in people's desks, and they don't usually contain bourbon. This one looked like it was empty.

As I sat down, he unscrewed the lid and passed me the bottle. Inside was a green piece of copper about the size of a paperclip. It was kind of flat but rough and bent.

Hank grinned slyly as if he was waiting for me to figure out a punchline. "Do you remember I told you I had some till samples?"

I peered skeptically into the bottle, then looked back at Hank. He was still waiting for me to figure out the punchline. I said tentatively, "This came from a till sample?"

He nodded, still grinning.

"Was it near a copper mine?"

He shook his head.

I should probably explain something about copper and other metals. If you go to a copper mine or an iron mine or a gold mine, you won't see any copper or iron or gold lying around. The metals combine with other elements, such as sulfur or oxygen, to form minerals. Those minerals often get mixed up with other minerals to form a bunch of rock. You might occasionally find "native" copper or gold, which is to say regular copper or gold that's not mixed with other stuff, but it's relatively rare.

Another thing to remember is that people have already found the obvious stuff. You'll never see copper lying around, because somebody would have picked it up already. Even the copper wires in abandoned buildings disappear, because homeless people pull them out and sell them to scrapyards. The deposits that geologists look for are well hidden.

It was pretty improbable that Hank could dig up some dirt and just happen to find a paperclip-sized piece of native copper. My first thought was that he had accidentally dug up something from the twentieth century. My second thought was that he was simply fucking with me.

"What is this, some weathered electrical wire?"

"Not unless sabertooth tigers had electric lights."

I was still skeptical. "Where did you find it?"

"Grosvenor."

This made things a little clearer. It also answered one of Zeke's questions. "You mean, our study area is in Grosvenor?"

"Yep. Have you been there yet?"

"No. Did you find this in town?"

"Have you heard of the Wolmaquill River?"

"No."

"Okay, have you heard of Namaskik Bay?"

"No." I felt like squirming. "I don't actually know where Grosvenor is."

He chuckled. "Okay. Grosvenor is at the head of Namaskik Bay, where the Wolmaquill River flows in. The bay is a drowned river valley that runs northeast to southwest. The coastline, as you prob'ly know, runs roughly east-west."

I actually thought the coast ran from north to south, but I nodded anyway.

"The valley the Wolmaquill River is in, the one that forms Namaskik Bay, has a lot of glacial sediment. Just about anyplace in Maine has a lot of glacial sediment."

"Makes sense."

"If you drive into Grosvenor, which you really oughta do..."

I nodded with contrition.

"... you go by a big cement plant. That's the Lamarck plant, and it's the biggest one in New England. They've got a big quarry there, right by the road."

"Uh-huh."

"There's a granitic dike that cuts right across the valley, and the quarry is just upstream from there."

A granitic dike is a place where magma flowed up into a crack and solidified to become granite. Magma is so hot that when it comes up like that, it usually cooks all the nearby rock. Like cookie dough in an oven, the preexisting rock partially melts and then solidifies as something different. And as I mentioned earlier, this is exactly the kind of event that can produce hot water with minerals dissolved in it, and the hot water and minerals can form veins of ore.

Hank continued. "The dike intruded into limestone, so you've got limestone and marble and some half-metamorphosed rock in between. The quarry started out as a marble quarry next to the dike, but there wasn't much decent marble, so they ground up the marble and the limestone and made cement out of it."

"So, are there metals in the quarry?"

Hank cocked one eyebrow and smiled. "That's the question, isn't it?"

I hate it when people don't answer my questions. "So," I said, "what's the answer?"

"Ask Zeke. He did some work in that quarry about fifty years ago. He published a paper on the metamorphosis of that limestone, but he didn't see anything but granite and carbonates. He didn't say a word about metals."

I wasn't sure if that was a yes or a no. "So, there aren't any metals?"

"You tell me. The copper was in the till downstream from the dike. I took samples upstream, too, and there's no copper upstream."

"When you say 'downstream,' are you referring to the flow direction of the river or the ice?"

"Aha! That's the question you're gonna answer."

"Oh. Is that what this project is about?"

"Now you're getting it. The ice had to be flowing down that valley, the same direction as the river,and the copper had to come from near that dike. That's what you're gonna prove."

"But, what's the mystery? I mean, is there any reason the ice wouldn't flow the same direction as the river?"

Hank waved a hand and spoke like he was reciting stale dogma. "'The general direction of ice flow in coastal Maine was northwest to southeast.' That's what everybody says. They think the ice just plowed right over that valley at right angles. But that's simplifying it too much. Ice doesn't work like that. They're not considering coastal effects."

"You mean like calving?" I was just trying to think of any coastal phenomenon I could that had to do with glaciers. I didn't want him to think I had no idea what he was talking about, even though that was, in fact, the case.

"Like what happens before calving. Look, what makes ice flow?"

"Plasticity?"

"Yeah, but where does its energy come from?"

"Gravity?"

"Exactly! Ice flows downhill. So what happens when a big ice sheet sits on a flat continent?"

"Um, I guess it doesn't go anywhere."

"Whaddya think made moraines and striations and all that other crap?"

Now I was getting confused. "Um, the ice was moving."

"Right! So what makes a continental ice sheet move? What makes the Greenland ice sheet move?"

"I guess it just sort of spreads out."

"Right! If you take a bunch of wet concrete and plop it on the ground, it doesn't just stack up like books. It oozes and spreads. The middle starts out tall and gets shorter, and the edges get farther and farther apart. It wants to be flat. It's because of gravity."

"Now I get it. The Greenland ice sheet is thick in the middle and thinner at the edges."

"Bingo! People always talk about this mile-thick sheet of ice dropping boulders on top of Mount Katahdin. But it wasn't a mile thick at the coast. If you go to Greenland, you don't see glaciers calving off a mile-high wall of ice. It's impossible. The ice gets thinner and thinner. It starts flowing between mountains and down into valleys and fjords. The flow at the edges is nothing like the interior flow. Do you know what a nunatak is?"

I was startled. Zeke had asked the same question. What are the chances that two different people would ask me what a freakin' nunatak is? "No," I said, hoping that Hank was about to answer one of Zeke's questions for me.

"It's a mountain that sticks up above the ice. You find 'em in Greenland and places like that. They're near the coasts. They stick out because the ice isn't as thick there. And it can't be, because if the ice was level, if the top of the ice was the same height everywhere, the ice wouldn't flow. It would just keep getting taller and taller."

This seemed like it almost made sense, but not quite. Applying it to a particular area seemed risky. "But during glaciations," I said, "the sea level was lower. What's coast now was interior then."

He got that annoyingly clever glint again. "No, it wasn't. The sea was lower, but so was the land."

Believe it or not, this was true. The weight of a continental ice sheet is so immense that it presses the Earth's crust downward a little bit. It's like having a bunch of extra mountains sitting on top of the land. In some areas, including the coast of Maine and the north shore of Lake Superior, the crust is still rising after being relieved of the weight of the ice. It's called "isostatic rebound."

I asked, "So, how did they compare? I mean, how did the fall in sea level compare to the depression of the crust?"

He waved both hands and shook his head. "They were all over the place. You've got old coastlines way up on dry land. The sea level went about fifty meters up and down, compared to the land. Not only did the ice push the crust down, but there was a see-saw effect, so the land beyond the margin rose up. When the ice margin advanced and retreated, these low and high parts moved back and forth, and meanwhile the water was going up and down. It's a mess. Unless you can find a shoreline that you can date, it's anybody's guess where sea level was at any given place and time."

"And I'm supposed to model this?" I was getting worried.

Hank laughed. "We'll make some assumptions. During the last advance, before the ice started melting, sea level was roughly where it is now. It stayed that way for tens of thousands of years. You can just assume a constant sea level for your model, and assume it was the same as now. All we have to do is show that the coast of Maine looked like the coast of Greenland or Antarctica does now. I mean, it's obvious. It had to."

"Why do we have to show it, then? I mean, if it's obvious, why bother?"

"'Cause you have to prove it. Common sense doesn't do it for these people."

I wasn't sure who "these people" were, but I assumed he was referring to some unintentional conspiracy of dimwitted scientists.

"Is the point of the model to find where the copper came from?"

"Oh, I already know where it came from. We just need to prove it."

Something about his statement gave me the willies, but I couldn't put my finger on it then. Months later, I would realize how profoundly flawed this project was. At the time, though, I took his word for it.

"I thought we were using the samples to show which way the ice flowed. Is it really the other way around?"

"It's both."

"Isn't there kind of a chicken-and-egg problem here?"

He waved his hand again. "They're mutually supportive. The evidence for one supports the other, and vice versa."

"Why not just go to the quarry and take a look? Do you think Zeke missed something?"

"Maybe he didn't look in the right places. Maybe they're not quarrying in the right places. They're not looking for copper, you know."

"The quarry must be bigger than it was fifty years ago. Should we go see if they've uncovered anything?"

"I tried that. They wouldn't let me in."

"Did you ask?"

"Did I ask the armed guards? Yeah. They've got their panties so bunched up about liability, they won't let anybody in there that's not on the clock. They're afraid I'll go get my ass blown off or something."

I had never heard of a quarry with armed guards, but it sounded like this was a pretty busy place.

"What about Zeke? How did he get in?"

"For one thing, it was fifty years ago. Nobody gave a shit back then. Plus, he's from Grosvenor. He knows those guys."

"Can't he get us in?"

Hank leaned back and crossed his arms. "Not me. Maybe you."

"Why, because I'm a student?"

"Because you're a Grosvenor boy."

"Oh, Jesus! Did I mention that I've never been there?"

"Yep."

"Are you aware that I don't know anybody there? I don't even have any relatives left there."

He smirked, and I knew he was thinking about my hillbilly genes. I didn't even want to start that conversation, so I changed the subject.

"What does Zeke think about all this? Does he think he might have missed anything?"

"Zeke doesn't know about the project. He prob'ly suspects, but I haven't told him anything."

"What do you mean? Is it secret?"

He leaned forward and put his elbows on his desk. "Zeke has resources. If I told him one of my ideas, he could get a grant and three grad students before he left for Arizona. They'd publish within a year."

When Zeke had told me Hank was paranoid, I had thought he was exaggerating. Now I realized that Hank was quite possibly more unhinged than Zeke, though in a less conspicuous way. I didn't want to mention to Hank that I had heard about his obsession with secrecy, so I talked about the other thing that had popped into my head.

"Is that where he goes, Arizona?"

"Yeah, every winter."

"He didn't mention that. I wonder what city he goes to."

"I dunno. Anyway, try to get whatever you can out of him, but try not to give anything away. I already tried asking him the obvious questions about the dike and what might be around it, the kind anybody would ask. He just said there's nothing there that anybody'd care about except granite, marble, and limestone. And he says they've gone all the way into the granite -- they crush it into gravel for aggregate -- and they never saw anything else. So he's been in there sometime in the past fifty years, and he could get in there again. But if he did, he'd be the one publishing, not us."

"How can I get him to get me in there if we can't tell him about the project?"

"Just wait 'till spring. We'll be farther along then, and you can tell him where we're looking. Don't tell him about this," -- he shook the Nalgene bottle with the copper in it -- "but you can tell him where we're working. He prob'ly has his suspicions anyway."

I would have used the term "educated guesses" rather than "suspicions," but that's just me. I was glad that Zeke was going away for the winter, just so I wouldn't have to deal with this crap yet. You'd think these two were divorced, for God's sake.
