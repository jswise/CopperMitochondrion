# Chapter 9

At the beginning of December, there was a huge snowstorm. Kieffer got really excited, and that was when I learned that Kieffer was a musher. His parents owned about twenty sled dogs, his mother competed in sled dog races, and he was definitely the first person I had ever met who had been on a dogsled.

The weekend after the snowstorm, Kieffer invited me to go dogsledding with him. I was quite surprised, because I had never imagined that I would ever go dogsledding. It seemed more like something that people do in cartoons. It certainly sounded interesting, though, so I took him up on it.

We drove out to his parents' house on a Saturday. It turned out to be not far from Grosvenor, on a penninsula next to Namaskik Bay.

The dogs lived outside. Each dog was on a chain next to its own doghouse, and each doghouse was full of straw. Kieffer explained that they had to keep the dogs apart to avoid fights. It was feeding time, so Kieffer's mother put some kind of dehydrated dog food in a five-gallon bucket and added a couple gallons of warm water. She then gave me the bucket and a ladle, and I deposited a glob of slop in front of each dog. I was too terrified to get within reach of the dogs, so I sort of tossed the stuff from the ladle.

By the time I fed the last dog, the first dog was already pooping. Fortunately, Kieffer took care of the other ritual of feeding time, venturing into each dog's radius to scoop up the fresh, gloppy product and toss it onto a plastic toboggan. He then took the loaded toboggan to a giant, frozen poop pile that was covered with snow. I was glad I hadn't visited in the summer.

When the eating and pooping were done, Kieffer explained how to handle the dogs. You may think your dog pulls hard on the leash, but a sled dog is like a small tractor, only faster. To manage one of these guys, you start by putting a chest harness on the dog while the dog is still connected to the chain. Then, in order to move the dog from one place to another, you grab the back of the harness and lift the front half of the dog off the ground. That way, if the dog tries to run, it ends up standing instead. While carrying half of a very heavy dog, you then jog to where you're going, praying that those front feet won't hit the ground until you've reached something you can tie the dog to.

Before you hitch the dogs to the sled, you have to make sure the sled is tied to something, preferably a good, strong tree. Otherwise, the dogs will go sledding without you. You might think that pulling a sled would be drudgery, but the dogs love it, and they're anxious to get going.

Kieffer hitched eight dogs to the sled, told me to hang on, and detached us from the tree. We lurched forward so hard that I nearly fell off the sled. These dogs were psyched.

The dogs plowed through deep snow until we reached a snowmobile trail that crossed the back of the property. As the first dogs emerged from the powder and found their footing on the packed trail, Kieffer yelled, "Haw, Nancy, haw!" The dogs followed the trail, and the sled nearly fell over as we made the transition. Once everybody was on the trail, the dogs got going even faster, but the sled glided almost silently.

"What does 'haw Nancy haw' mean?" I asked.

Kieffer said, "That means 'Turn left.' 'Gee' means right." He pronounced the "g" like the "g" in "get."

"Is Nancy one of the dogs?"

"Yeah, she's the lead dog, the little one in front. She's the one I talk to."

As he spoke, he watched the dogs as critically as a veterinarian. They all looked the same to me, and I was mainly concerned with staying on the sled.

We came to a fork in the trail, and Kieffer yelled, "Gee, Nancy, gee!" Nancy took the right fork, which was a little smaller than the trail we'd been on.

"There's a lotta snowmobilers out here," Kieffer said. "A lot of 'em are drunk, and they don't give a shit about mushers."

I looked behind us, suddenly paranoid. "Do they ever hit people?"

"Yeah, one guy died. He got rear-ended. The snowmobiler took off, and they never found out who it was."

I had no idea this was going to be so dangerous. "Do you want me to face backward or something?"

Kieffer laughed. "No, we'll hear 'em. It's easy to tell when they're coming; the trouble is they can't hear us. They can't hear each other, either. They kill a lot more of each other and themselves than they do of us."

Knowing that snowmobilers were constantly crashing into each other or into trees didn't make me think our odds were any better, unless the accidents substantially reduced the number of snowmobilers.

Kieffer added, "They keep the trails groomed, anyway. Snowmobiles make nice trails."

His critical stare turned into a scowl, and he yelled, "Nathaniel, no!"

I looked forward and saw that two of the dogs were starting to get pissed off at each other. They snarled and snapped, and then suddenly they stopped running and started fighting. The other dogs stopped, and Kieffer picked up an anchor and rammed it into the snow. Then he grabbed a piece of PVC pipe that I hadn't previously noticed, and I saw it had been within easy reach on the sled. Kieffer rushed forward and thwacked the one on the right with the pipe. He yelled again, and he was really frightening. He seemed even angrier than the dogs, which I guess was the point. The dogs stopped fighting, and he untangled their lines. They all started pulling again, straining the anchor line. Kieffer stomped back to the sled, put the pipe back in its place, told me to hang on again, and pulled the anchor out of the snow.

I felt really awkward at that point. I felt like I had just seen Kieffer's dark side, and I had no idea what to say about it.

Kieffer said, "Sorry about that. You have to be careful, 'cause they can really hurt each other. You have to stop it right in the bud."

"Is that why you have the pipe?"

"Yeah. Some people use a two by four, but this works, too."

"Jesus!"

Kieffer laughed. "It sounds mean, but they're tough dogs. You can't just roll up a newspaper like when your poodle goes wee-wee on the floor. You have to get their attention, and they have to be more afraid of you than they are of the other dog. I mean, it'd be a lot worse if you didn't do anything, 'cause they'd rip each other up."

That seemed to make sense, and I decided that he wasn't evil after all. Mushing, I thought, just required a certain willingness to discover one's inner demon.

Just when I'd come to grips with that idea, I heard snowmobiles approaching. I didn't know if I should hold on tighter or jump off the sled and run into the woods. They got louder and louder, and Kieffer urged Nancy to run along the right side of the trail.

The first snowmobile appeared ahead of us and abruptly slowed down. The driver looked inhuman in dark goggles and a mask. He, or it, pointed at the dogs, and I was afraid he was expressing anger. Then I saw that there was a kid on the back of the snowmobile, and the driver was simply pointing the dogs out to the kid. I hadn't realized that people took their kids snowmobiling. The kid was bundled up just like the parent, and they looked like two black mummies.

A second snowmobile appeared behind the first, and this one had a pink mummy on the back. Kieffer stopped the dogs, and the snowmobilers waved as they carefully drove around us. Once they were behind us, they revved up their engines and zoomed away. The smell of exhaust lingered in their wake.

"That wasn't as terrifying as I thought it would be," I said.

"Yeah," said Kieffer, "most of 'em are nice."

After a while, the dogs got over their initial fanaticism and settled into a trot. I relaxed a little, too. Every few minutes, we encountered more snowmobilers, sometimes alone and sometimes in herds. They all went fast, and they all slowed down so suddenly that I thought they'd throw themselves off their machines. They avoided us pretty well, but I kept wondering what would happen if they came from both directions at once.

After we'd been out for about half an hour, I saw some odd tracks running perpendicular to the trail. The dogs saw them too, and they immediately went nuts. They lunged forward, stopped to sniff the tracks, and then tried to take off again in both directions at once. Kieffer went through his anchor-and-pipe routine again, this time yelling at the whole bunch but not thwacking any of them with the pipe. The dogs settled down, but they were clearly anxious. When Kieffer got back on the sled and pulled up the anchor, he had to yell to get the dogs going again, because they still wanted to investigate the tracks.

"What were those, deer tracks?"

Kieffer shook his head. "Grosvenor dogs."

That was not what I expected to hear. "Grosvenor dogs?" I asked.

"Yeah. Sled dogs. Those were sled tracks. They always get excited when they smell tracks, dogs or deer or whatever. But when they really freak out like that, it's 'cause they smell Grosvenor dogs."

I wondered if he was joking, but Kieffer had never given me shit about Grosvenor before. He was serious.

"How can they tell they're from Grosvenor?"

"They're not just from Grosvenor. It's a special breed. You don't see 'em anywhere else."

"Eleanore and I went to Grosvenor at Thanksgiving, and we saw a big, white dog that Eleanore was scared of. Is that the kind you mean?"

"Yeah, big, white, and fuckin' nasty. They wanna kill all the other dogs, and all the other dogs wanna kill them. They're all really big, though, and they'd prob'ly just eat our dogs."

"Are they huskies?"

"I dunno. They're some kind of big, badass dogs. They're good at pulling, but they can't be in races 'cause they're so fuckin' mean."

"You mean they get disqualified?"

"Naw, the owners just know better. Most of 'em, anyway. One guy from Grosvenor tried running the Beargrease, but the dogs got into so many fights they had to quit at the second checkpoint.

"The guy was a freak, too. A friend of mine was in that race, and he said the guy fed his dogs bones."

I thought about this for a second, but I didn't get it. "Don't mushers normally give their dogs bones?"

"Well, yeah, I mean, dogs like bones to chew on. But in a race, they need meat. The people get peanut butter, but the dogs get steak. They need it for running. This guy, it's like he couldn't afford steak, so he just gave 'em bones. He shoulda just given 'em regular dog food, for Chrissake. They were so fuckin' hungry they chomped the bones. Not like gnawing on 'em, you know, but like crunching and eating. My friend offered the guy some real food, 'cause he felt sorry for the poor dogs, but he wouldn't take it."

"Weird!"

"Yeah. A friend of my parents' got one and tried breeding it with regular dogs; thought maybe he could get dogs that were big but not mean. It didn't work."

"You mean they turned out small and mean?"

"Naw, they just didn't have any puppies. The dogs just wanted to fight, not fuck. You'll never see a half-Grosvenor dog."

"Does everybody in Grosvenor have big, mean dogs?"

"Just about. It's like the dogs are inbred, like the people." After a pause, he said, "Um, no offense."

"I'm used to it."

After another half hour, we reached the Wolmaquill River. "Usually we'd cross it," said Kieffer, "but it's not frozen yet."

"Did it freeze and then melt? It looks like there are already snowmobile tracks across it."

"Naw, they just cross it anyway. If you go fast enough on a snowmobile, you can make it go across water. A lot of people sink their machines that way, though."

I tried to imagine what would possess someone to drive a heavy machine across frigid water, but it was just unfathomable.

We turned around, and I was glad. The sun was setting, and it was rapidly getting colder. It looked like it would be dark by the time we got back to the house.

On the trip back, we didn't see nearly as many snowmobiles. They must have gone home or hit the bars. I was still worried, though, and as dusk fell, I wondered if we should be wearing flashing lights or something. The few snowmobiles that we did see seemed to be going faster than before.

As it got darker, the dogs and the trees all became silhouettes against the snow and the dim sky. It was nice and quiet for a long time, and I really enjoyed just sliding through the darkness with the anonymous dogs. Even Kieffer started to disappear into the twilight, and I almost felt like I was alone.

Then Kieffer broke the silence. He pointed, reaching in front of my face so I could see his arm, and asked, "What's that?"

There was a small light in the forest. At first I thought it was a snowmobile, but it wasn't bright enough, and whatever it was didn't make any noise. The light flickered and moved in a way that was strange but familiar. I had seen it before in a different context.

"It's somebody wearing a headlamp," I said. "Is it a skier?"

"It's too fast."

I hadn't noticed, but the light was definitely moving, and it was approaching the trail in front of us. It flashed across the trees as the wearer's head moved. Then the beam bobbed downward, and for a split second it illuminated a team of dogs. The person with the headlamp was on a dogsled.

Kieffer saw it, too, and apparently so did Nancy. She barked, and then all the dogs barked, and the headlamp turned on us like a lighthouse.

At this point, the other musher's dogs were emerging onto the trail in front of us. The light jerked in several directions, and I thought the musher might fall off the sled. Then the light bobbed down again, and this time the other dogs were between us and the light. Both teams of dogs were running toward each other. The other dogs were all white, and in the darkness they looked like an evil flock of sheep.

"Shit!" said Kieffer. He reached down, and then, to my astonishment, he stepped off the speeding sled and left me alone with the dogs. I looked back, wondering if I should stay on or jump off, and I saw his silhouette crouching. Just when I figured out that he was planting the anchor, the line went taught, and I did a Heimlich maneuver on the sled.

I checked to make sure I could still breathe, and Kieffer ran by and grabbed the pipe. Kieffer's dogs were pulling so hard that they were going up on their hind legs, snarling and snapping.

That was when I heard the other dogs barking. It was not the sound of ordinary dogs. It was low, and it was loud, and it was terrifying. If bears could bark, this is what they would sound like. I remained on the sled, clutching it with both hands, glad that a team of huskies was between me and that sound.

The other sled stopped moving, and the musher ran forward. It was a man, and I could hear him yelling at his dogs even more fiercely than Kieffer. His light flashed across the dogs, cutting through clouds of steam that shot from their mouths like the breath of a locomotive. I couldn't see the man's face or the faces of the dogs; it was just light and steam and flashes of white fur. He was even shorter than I am, and the dogs were huge, so I wondered if they might just turn on him and crunch his bones.

I heard a sound that made me jump, and even Kieffer stopped yelling and swinging the pipe to see what had happened. For a second, I thought the other person had shot one of his dogs. Then I saw his arm move in front of the light, and I heard the sound again. He was cracking a whip.

Kieffer's silhouette went back to disciplining the dogs. The other musher turned his back to us, and he seemed to disappear as the headlamp turned the other way. In the light of the lamp, I saw the dogs alternate between lunging at us and jerking backward to escape the whip.

I couldn't imagine how we could possibly get out of this situation. We obviously couldn't pull the dogs away from each other, and we couldn't go anywhere without weighing anchor and risking a melee. I wondered what I would do if the dogs attacked each other -- should I jump in or just stay out and let them kill each other?

Then I saw that the other dogs were shifting. Each time they lunged and retreated from the whip, they moved away from us a little bit. They were moving toward the side of the trail, and their sled was slowly turning. When the front dogs were off the side of the trail, the musher got on the sled and kept cracking the whip between the dogs and us. He weighed anchor, and the dogs grudgingly walked into the woods, still barking as they went.

Kieffer's dogs never let up, and seeing the other dogs leave just emboldened them. We waited for several minutes as the light slowly disappeared, and eventually they stopped barking and switched to an agitated whimper. Finally, they decided they wanted to go home, and we were off.

By this time, it was totally dark. The trail was nothing more than a faint glow among the black trees. We encountered one snowmobile, and its headlight blinded us. As it went by and left us in the dark again, with the smell of exhaust and the fading whine of the engine, I realized that snowmobiles no longer seemed like so much of a threat. They seemed familiar in comparison with other things out here.
