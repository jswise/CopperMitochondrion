# Chapter 14

On Monday, I had a grueling final exam for hydrogeochemistry.  The professor, Dianna, had a signature format for her tests:  one question, open notes.  You might think it sounds really easy, but the format gave her the freedom to ask the hardest question imaginable.  We had two hours for the test, and all five of us -- in other words, those of us who hadn't already dropped out of the class -- could have used more time to answer Dianna's one question.

After the test, I stopped in to see Hank before studying for my next test.  Hank had some news.

"You know the Bowman Award for geostatistics?" he asked.

"No, I haven't heard of that."

"Well, every year, the Geostatistical Society gives out an award to the best geostatistician, and then the winner goes on a lecture tour.  They just added Mines to the tour at the last minute, and she's coming this Thursday.  It's Linda Collins."

"Really?  I've read some of her papers."

"Yeah, I know.  I thought you'd wanna know, since you've been into geostatistics lately."

He was right.  After our previous discussion about how to set up the model, something still bothered me about our project, and I had started reading about geostatistics so I could quantify my suspicions.

Geostatistics is basically the statistics of locations.  If someone does a regular statistical study of, say, voter preferences or the life expectancy of light bulbs, then you can use the information to predict how people are likely to vote or how long light bulbs are likely to last.  You can also identify correlations between different variables, so for example you can predict how people with certain religious beliefs will vote or how long lightbulbs of a specific wattage will last.

With geostatistics, you can find correlations based on location.  For example, if you dig up some soil at various locations and test it for gasoline contamination, you can predict what you're likely to find at the next location, or you can see if there's a correlation between the location of contamination and a particular gas station.

In any kind of statistical study, the sample size is important.  If you poll a thousand voters, you can get a surprisingly accurate picture of what voters nationwide are thinking, as long as your voters are randomly chosen.  If you just ask a few friends how they're voting, then you won't get any good data.  Maybe your friends are all voting for Bozo the Clown, but that doesn't mean everybody's voting for Bozo.

Although Hank had convinced me that we could get away with making huge assumptions about ice thickness and things like that, I was still uneasy about how we were using Hank's till samples.  Aside from the problem of circular logic -- using the samples to calibrate a model and using the model to show where the samples came from -- there just weren't enough samples to draw much of a conclusion about anything. It was pretty much like the Bozo analogy I just mentioned.

When I asked Hank about the parts that didn't seem to make sense, he would do a bit of arm-waving and then say, "If you were a glaciologist, you'd understand."  It was immensely annoying.

More ominously, I suspected that Hank was cherrypicking data.  Cherrypicking is when you use only the data that support your hypothesis and ignore the data you don't like.  Hank was evasive about how many samples he had sifted through when he found his one piece of copper.  He made it sound like he had only been allowed to collect a few samples below the dike, one of which contained the copper.  But I suspected that there were more negatives below the dike than he let on.

Linda Collins, who started as a mathematician before delving into geology, had written some insightful papers about working with sparse samples.  If I got a chance to ask her a few questions, I might be able to decide once and for all if our samples were actually good for anything.

The only problem with talking to Dr. Collins was Hank's paranoia.  If he was worried about Zeke stealing his idea, he must be terrified of talking to a Bowman-award-winning scientist from another university.  There in Hank's office, I asked, "So, can we talk to her?"

"You can ask her questions.  Just don't talk too much about what we're doing."

On the day of the lecture, Tom Hopkins organized a pizza lunch with the graduate students, a few professors, Linda Collins, and the president of the Geological Society of Maine, Grace Wilson, who was traveling with her.  We crowded into a conference room, and some people sat at the conference table while the rest of us sat on extra chairs around the edge of the room.

Tom talked briefly about some of his projects, and a couple of his students said a sentence or two.  Then he stretched his neck to see me at the other end of the room.  "Ian and Hank are working on a project with an interesting geostatistical component.  Ian, why don't you tell Linda about what you guys are doing?"

I looked at Hank, who was sitting next to me.  All I saw on Hank's face was curiosity about what I would say.

"Sure.  Um..."  With another glance at Hank, I sheepishly launched into a description of our project.  I didn't specifically mention Hank's piece of copper;  I just said we found "measurable" copper.  Hank didn't look perturbed, but I wondered if he was secretly simmering.  My description came out half-assed, partly because I was hesitant to talk about our project and partly because there just wasn't much to say about it.

When I finished, Linda Collins took a moment to stare at me with her mouth closed and take a deep breath through her nose.  When she opened her mouth, I felt like she was picking up a scalpel.  "So," she began, "you're..."  And then, in the space of a few seconds, she concisely described all the important parts of our project.  Hearing it condensed like that, it sounded ridiculous.

She was trying to be tactful, but she couldn't help asking a few incisive questions -- pretty much the same questions I had been asking Hank.  I didn't have the answers, but at that point Hank chimed in.  He answered the questions in his characteristically evasive style, leaving Linda visibly puzzled.  She asked, "But does that really give you enough information to model the glacial flow independently?"

Then Hank said the words I never thought he would say to anyone with a Ph.D.  He said, "If you were a glaciologist, you'd understand."

Linda's traveling companion, the president of the Geological Society of Maine, said, "I am a glaciologist, and I don't understand."

I wanted to crawl under my chair.

Tom Hopkins interjected with a delightful project that someone else was working on.  I didn't say another word.
