# Chapter 17

The cops took us to a small, white church outside Grosvenor.  Most churches are on main roads, and they have signs to encourage new people to come.  This one was in an obscure location on a steep, dirt road, and it had no sign at all.  It was like one of those church buildings that aren't churches anymore, the ones that have been abandoned or turned into houses.

Surprisingly, this odd little church building had a large, paved parking lot that had been plowed.  It was illuminated by a light on a pole, like a streetlight.  Two cars sat in the lot, and although it was the middle of the night, some people were standing behind the cars and chatting.

We pulled in next to the other cars.  Naturally, Frances and I couldn't open our doors.  While the male cop continued to play his flute, which he had never stopped playing, he opened his door with his left hand and got out.  Still playing, he opened Frances's door.  The other cop opened my door and gestured toward the other people.  I got out and walked toward them.  Frances walked with me.

The cop with the flute reached the group before we did.  As we approached, his tune changed to a little flourish, and then he finally stopped playing.  He held a hand toward me and announced, "Ian Aaron Dawson!"

There were two straight couples, one elderly and one young.  The young guy had a baby strapped to his chest, and the baby was trying to sleep.  Needless to say, they were all short, pale, and bald.  Inexplicably, one person in each couple carried a sleeping pad, the kind you'd use if you were camping.  The young woman also had a Thermos, which was understandable.

All the adults smiled and shook my hand.  They said another word that I had never heard, which sounded like "eh'ahtlul."  They said the word to Frances and the cops, too, but it was clear that I was the guest of honor here, for whatever reason.

The female cop said to the other people, "Thanks for coming this late.  I hate to get everybody out of bed."

The old guy smiled and said, "Not at all!  It's never a bad time."

By the way, you can just assume that everyone in Grosvenor has a Maine accent, and the older they are, the stronger it is.  For your sake and mine, I'll stop trying to write what the accent sounds like, and you can just imagine it.  But I can't help writing the way people talk, with all their unofficial contractions.

Anyway, the old guy looked at me and said, "I understand you're Marguerite DuFresne's grandson."

"Uh, yeah.  And Arch Gustavson."

"Sure!  I remember Arch.  Nice kid for a Pukruh."

Before I had a chance to ask what he was talking about, the old lady said, "I'm so sorry about your mother, passing away when you were so young, out there in New Mexico."

"Arizona."

"Oh, that's right, Arizona!  I always get them mixed up.  It's such a shame you didn't have anyone to teach you."

Her husband scoffed.  "Madeleine?  She wouldn'ta taught 'im shit.  We never woulda seen 'im again if she had lived.  You think she woulda let him go to Mines?"

I was stunned.  It was weird enough that the lady had talked about my mother, and for the guy to turn around and insult her was over the top.  I had never heard anyone say anything bad about my mother before.  "What do you mean about my mother?" I asked the man.

"She hated the Kayhotul and everything about us.  She didn't want any kid of hers knowing the old ways.  She tried to be a Pukruh, and you can see how much good it did her."

The lady said, "That's such a shame.  We're just not meant to live in a place like that.  It nearly killed Marguerite, too."

"Arizona?"

The man said, "Aw, it wasn't the heat killed her.  It was tryin' to live like a Pukruh.  Threw her metabolism all outta whack."

"She had diabetes."

"Damn right she did!"

Everyone turned as another car drove up.  The female cop said, "Oh, good!  It's Mildred.  Now we can get out of the cold."

I said to the old guy, "What's a Pukruh?"

He laughed again.  "They don't tell you anything, do they?  Pukruhs are white people.  You and I are Kayhotul."

"You mean, you don't consider us white?"

"Sure, we're white-colored, but not like them.  Not like three quarters of you.  Pukruh are European.  Remember those ads for pork?  We're the other white meat!"  He turned with a guffaw and started toward the church building.

Two people got out of the last car to drive up.  The driver was a man in his forties, and the passenger was an elderly woman.  The guy opened the door behind the driver's seat and pulled out two sleeping pads.

The group moved to greet them, and then everyone walked toward the front door of the church building.  That is, everyone except Frances and myself.  I didn't move, and Frances watched me expectantly.  When everybody else was halfway to the door, the two cops lingered, keeping an eye on me, while the rest continued.

Frances took my hand and tugged it.  "Come on!  It'll be fun."

"What the fuck was he talking about?"

"You'll understand when we're inside."

"I'm not going in there!  This is way too fucked up."

She sighed and stopped tugging on my hand.  "You still think this is about a cult, huh?"

"Is it?"

She laughed.  "Only in a prehistoric sense.  It's not like the kind of cult you're thinking of."

"What the fuck is a prehistoric cult?"

After thinking for a few seconds, she asked, "What kind of rock is under us?"

I looked at her incredulously.  "What?"

"The bedrock," she said.  "What kind is it?"

"I know what you said.  I don't see what the fuck it has to do with anything.  Do different kinds of cults exist in different geologic settings?"

"Just tell me.  It'll help you understand."

I sighed, trying to shift gears and think about the geologic maps I had studied.  "I'm not sure where we are," I said.

"You know how Grosvenor's in a sort of fjordlike thing, and there's a peninsula that sticks out next to it?"

"Yeah."

"We're on the other side of the peninsula, and about half a kilometer inland from the big bay that's on the other side."

I looked around.  "I guess we're on limestone, but there's shale on top of the hill."

"Are there any caves?"

I shook my head.  "No, there aren't any caves anywhere around here.  I don't think there are any dissolution caves in Maine."

"Okay.  Now, you know those songs your gramma used to sing to you?"

I had to shift gears again.  I saw everyone go inside except the cops.  "Yeah?"

"You know Frere Jacques?"

"I don't think she sang that one."

"I know, but do you know it?"

"Um..."  I hummed the first few lines.  "Just the first part, 'Frere Jacques, dorme vous?'"

"Yeah, right.  It's totally different from your gramma's songs, huh?"

This was getting too random.  I said snidely, "And does this relate to limestone?  Is it a French prehistoric limestone cult that sings Frere Jacques?"

She stood in front of me and held both of my hands.  She looked at me like she was trying to calm me down.  "Ian," she said slowly, "Your gramma's songs aren't French.  Your gramma wasn't French.  We're not French.  You know why I have a fretless guitar, and I have that special capo?"

"What's a capo?"

"Never  mind.  We'll talk about capos sometime.  The thing is, you can't even play those songs on a regular guitar.  They're on a different scale.  The frets wouldn't be in the right places.

"Okay," I said tentatively.  All I knew about music was what I'd learned in physics class, but I could see how it kind of made sense.  I mean, the part about the scale made sense, though the situation as a whole was getting weirder by the minute.

"Oh, and remember when I swabbed your cheek cells?"

[he already thought about this!  Why the surprise?]

Finally, I at least knew where one of her trains of thought was going  "Lemme guess," I said.

"Um, please don't hate me."

"You didn't give my cheek cells to Colleen, did you?"

"Huh-uh.  I couldn't let her see your DNA, because you're the one she was looking for.  You're the one with the weird mitochondria that she found the first time."

I thought this seemed like a bit of a leap.  "How would you know what kind of mitochondria I have?"

"'Cause I know where you came from.  I mean, I can't be totally positive it was you, unless we test you again.  You're the only Kayhotul who's ever been tested -- I didn't give her mine either time.  So it's not like I looked at Colleen's results and said, 'Oh yeah, that's Kayhotul DNA,' 'cause nobody knows what Kayhotul DNA is like."  She turned more serious.  "This is important:  We can't get tested, including you.  You can't ever let yourself get tested again.  Not unless someday a Kayhotul can run the test in secret."

"What are you talking about?  My mitochondrial DNA is secret?"

"No one's allowed to know about us.  Everybody's supposed to think we're French Canadian inbred Mainers."

"But we're really just inbred Mainers."

"Yeah.  Well, you're only a quarter inbred."

"But being inbred doesn't give you weird mitochondria.  It would just mean that we all have the same mitochondria."

"It's not 'cause we're inbred.  It's because we've been around so long."

"What, two hundred years?  You'd have to go back a lot farther than that to find the kind of variation Colleen found.  She was talking about a parallel bottleneck.  That's some heavy shit."

"Yeah, and which Mines student do you think is the one?  Can you think of somebody else?"

"I dunno, somebody from a really small population that had never been tested before.  A population that, um..."

"Yeah?  A population that was isolated for thousands of years from the rest of humanity?"

"Yeah."

"Like who?"

"I don't know.  I don't know who else she tested."

She made an exhasperated noise.  "Can you think of anyone on the planet that would qualify?"

"Maybe some tribe in New Guinea that just recently made contact with outsiders."  By the time I finished the sentence, I knew it didn't make sense.  The tribe would have to have been isolated during a bottleneck that happened a hundred thousand years ago, not just recently.

"Yeah, nice hypothesis, man.  Look at it this way:  Forget about Colleen for now.  We'll say you have regular DNA.  But come and learn who you are; learn who your grandmother was.  Find out what it means to be a Kayhotul.  Then we can talk about who has the weird mitochondria."

I looked at the church building.  The two cops were still waiting for us.  The lights were on inside, and stained glass windows glowed on the side of the building.  The windows were abstract, with no pictures or writing.

I let go of one of Frances's hands, but I kept hold of the other.  We walked toward the building.  As we approached, the cops stepped aside.  Then they followed us, as if to make sure I wouldn't change my mind and bolt.

On entering the building, I was struck by how boring it was.  If this was a cult, it was a cult that valued blandness.  Tacky light fixtures from the 1970s hung from the ceiling, and the pulpit was just a podium with a little reading light on top.  The altar was a wooden table like you'd see at a furniture store, with no Biblical quotes or religious symbols on it.  Even the pews looked extra-bland somehow.

Another odd thing about this sanctuary was that there were no people in it.  I stopped and asked, "Are we supposed to go to the basement or something?"

Frances laughed.  She turned to the cops, who were closing the door behind us, and said, "He wants to know if we should go to the basement."

The cops laughed, too.  The male cop said, "Yeah, just go to the stairs and keep going down."  This didn't make me feel any more comfortable.

Frances said, more reassuringly, "The stairs are this way."

Just as we turned, I realized what was odd about the pews.  They didn't have any hymnals or prayer books in the racks.  It was like the pews had just been delivered, and no one had actually used them yet.  I asked, "Do they put all the books away at night?"

She said, "We don't need books.  We know all the songs and stories by heart."

"You memorized the Bible?"

She giggled.  "No, we sing songs, just like Homer did."

She let go of my hand and led me down a creaking stairway to the basement.  This place was lit with fluorescent lights, and it had small columns to hold up the sanctuary.  Big coffee urns sat on folding tables by the walls, and there were bulletin boards covered with announcements.  In one corner, there was a stack of folded-up tables and a rack of folded chairs.  It all looked pretty normal, though bland, except for the fact that it was, like the sanctuary, devoid of people.

The male cop said, "I'm gonna make some coffee.  I'll meet you guys down there."

I followed Frances to a door at the other end of the room.  I noticed that the door was made of steel and had two deadbolts.  It also had a little magnetic switch for a burglar alarm.

Frances opened the door, which was unlocked, and stepped through.  I followed her into a very unexpected space.  I expected a small, windowless room, but what I found was downright windy.

The room had no ceiling.  Looking up, I could see the inside of the steeple.  The steeple was wide and totally empty, so I could see right up to the top.  The top part had open sides, and it was illuminated by the light from the parking lot.

In front of us was an opening in the building's foundation.  This opening appeared to be the entrance to a mine.  It was a shaft that led down at a forty-five-degree angle, with concrete steps and hanging light bulbs in yellow, plastic cages.  A steady breeze blew up the shaft and out through the steeple.

Frances said, "Here's where we get to see the limestone."  Then she headed down the stairs.

You might be thinking that you would turn and run at this point, but I was fascinated.  I was beyond wondering who these people were or what they were going to do to me.  This shaft presented a more compelling mystery than the crazy cops or the bland church or any of the weird shit that Frances had said outside.  Sketchy people and boring churches are a dime a dozen, but a shaft like this has something to say.  Drilling and blasting and building concrete stairs costs money.  Nobody would do it without a good reason, and nobody could do it without the necessary expertise.  Either the shaft led to a geologic anomaly that wasn't on the maps, or it was dug by a cult of engineers who just really wanted to be undergound.  Either way, I wanted to see what was down there.

I followed Frances.  The top part of the shaft was lined with concrete, but the concrete quickly gave way to bare limestone.  Behind me, I heard the female cop shut the door, but I didn't hear any deadbolts clicking.

The wires for the lights were held up by small, stainless steel pins driven into the rock.  I thought the stainless steel was a nice touch -- these pins would last a lot longer than ordinary steel pins.  In fact, they'd last longer than the people who put them there.  The steps were also nicely done, with litte channels on both sides to catch water.  There were handrails made of aluminum tubing.  The most remarkable thing was that each step had a stainless steel edge to protect the concrete from our feet.  Most concrete steps eventually start to crumble, but these would be around for a while.  What the church building lacked in accoutrements, this shaft made up for in its attention to detail.

It was hard to guess what this shaft was for.  Its strangeness went well beyond the fastidious design and the fact that it came out in a church.  I couldn't imagine why anyone would dig at this angle and build stairs, rather than digging a vertical shaft with an elevator or a horizontal shaft with a track.  Stairs just aren't good for getting equipment in or rock out.  They're not even very efficient for getting people in and out.  I decided that this must not be the only entrance to whatever it was that we were entering.  They must have dug this upward from the bottom and let the rock roll down, rather than digging downward and hauling the rock out the top.  Maybe it was originally an air shaft, and someone enlarged it.  Maybe it was an emergency exit.  But it still seemed too odd and too elaborate for any explanation I could think of.

When we were about twenty feet below the level of the church basement, we hit a landing.  On both sides of the landing were what looked like drifts, the lateral tunnels that miners dig when they hit a vein of ore.  I looked up at the ceiling, what miners call the "back" of the mine, to see the vein.  I saw nothing but blank limestone.

I stopped and peered into the drifts.  They were unlit, and their floors were covered with batshit.  From what I could see, the drifts appeared to be quite straight, not like drifts that follow veins of ore.  Frances had stopped to see what I was doing, so I asked, "What's this?"

She said, "Those are for the bats.  That's where they live.  They fly in and out through the steeple."

I couldn't tell if she was joking.  Skeptically, I asked, "This is a bat-friendly mine?"

She giggled.  "It's not a mine, but yeah, it's bat-friendly."

"Why is all this here?  I mean, if it's not a mine, then why did somebody dig it?"

"They dug it so we could get down here.  There are other ways to get in, but this one's the most convenient."

"Yeah, but I mean, why did anyone want to get down here in the first place?"

She smiled.  "That's what you're gonna learn about."

She turned and continued down the stairs.  I glanced back at the cop, who had stopped a few steps above me, and then I followed her.

It wasn't long before we hit the bottom of the stairs.  Ahead of us was a straight, horizontal tunnel that disappeared into darkness.  The lights in the tunnel weren't on, so I could just see enough to know that it was long.  It had a track that ended right at the bottom of the stairs.

To our right was another set of stairs, where the lights were on.  This stairway was short, and it led to a short tunnel.  At the end of the tunnel, to my further surprise, we stepped into a cave.

Looking around, fascinated, I asked, "Is this why you were asking me about caves?"

"Yup.  Nice, huh?"

"I never knew this was here."

"It's a secret.  Only the Kayhotul know.  This is where we come from."

"What, the cave?  We come from a cave?"

"Yup."

"Is that why you said it's a prehistoric cult?"

"I didn't really say that.  I said it's not really a cult, except maybe in a prehistoric sense.  I didn't mean because of the cave, though.  I meant because it's not like the kind of cult they talk about on TV."  I decided there was no point in trying to figure out what she was talking about.

This wasn't a big, fancy cave like you've seen pictures of.  It was an ordinary cave, the kind tourists don't normally visit.  It was just big enough to walk in, and it was crooked, so we couldn't see very far.  This was just a route that water had found on its way to the ocean.  It was dry, indicating that the water had since found some other route.

The cave ran to our right and to our left.  To the left, which I had the feeling was upstream, it was dark.  To our right, the lights were on.  I was mildly alarmed to see that the lights, wires, and stainless steel pins continued into the cave, since it's my understanding that spelunkers are never supposed to damage caves.  This didn't feel like spelunking, though, and a Kayhotul cave apparently had its own rules.

We followed the lighted part of the cave.  Occasionally, the cave abruptly changed elevation, and there were nice steps and aluminum handrails to make passage more convenient.  The floor of the cave appeared to have been flattened, too.

We reached the end of the lights.  The passage we had been following converged with another and led into an irregular room.  The room was about the size of a one-car garage, and it was lit by weird little oil lamps.  A dark passage led out the other side of the room.

This was where the people had gathered.  The old woman who had arrived in the last car sat on a sleeping pad on the floor.  The other people sat facing her in a semicircle, also on pads.  The old couple was next to a large chime made of green copper, which hung from a stand that was rooted in the floor.  The young man rythmically jostled his baby while his wife poured coffee into a travel mug.  Everybody was in a festive mood, like they were sitting down to watch a football game.

The man who had come in the last car looked at us and got up.  "You guys can use my pad," he said.

Frances said, "Oh, it's okay.  We can sit on the floor."

"No, take it," he said.  "It's gonna be a long night.  I'm gonna get up and walk around, anyhow.  I can't sit that long."

Frances chuckled and thanked him.  She led me to the pad, and we both sat down.  The man sat down on the dusty floor, and the cop did the same.  The floor was made of a hard, calcareous mud that resembled concrete.

I studied one of the lamps.  It was hard to tell what the lamp looked like without shining a light on it, but it seemed to be a short, copper cylinder with a flame coming out the top.  It kind of looked like a can of Sterno.  It sat in a little recess that someone had carved into the wall, and the top of the recess was totally black.  A line of soot led up the sloping wall from the recess.  The other lamps were similar, and it was clear from the soot that they got a lot of use.

As I looked around, I saw that that there were a lot of small, copper boxes attached to the walls.  Some were the size of a shoebox, but most were about the right size for a pair of glasses.  They were oxidized to a green patina.  On those closest to me, I could see random indentations that looked like cuneiform writing.  I couldn't tell if the other boxes had the same dents.  I noticed one that had bits of azurite and malachite, which are blue and green minerals, attached to the front.

The woman in front of us was meditating.  On her lap was a musical instrument that looked a bit like the bow you'd use to play a cello.  It had two strings, and it had a uniform width.  In other words, it was shaped like a long, narrow rectangle.  It appeared to be made of a piece of square, copper tubing.  The body of the instrument probably acted as a narrow soundbox that was as long as the strings.  Most of the copper was green, but there were spots under the strings that had been polished by use.

Other people were taking off their coats.  Under their coats, they had sweaters or fleece jackets on.  With the exception of the cop and myself, everyone was prepared for this particular temperature.

The old woman with the stringed instrument stopped meditating and smiled at me.  "My name is Angeline," she said.  "I knew your grandmother, and I sang to your mother when she was a baby.  So did many of us."

Changing the subject, she gestured toward the room.  "Here we sing songs, and the songs tell stories, and the stories tell us who we are."  She put her fingers on the strings of her instrument.  "Do you remember any of the songs that your grandmother sang?"

I wasn't sure what to say, but Frances answered for me.  "He knows the Tnaha'lapec."  Everyone laughed, but I had no idea what was funny.

Angeline said, "Good!  You can sing with us."  To the man who had given us his seat, she said, "Tom, could you get Arch Gustavson's ketnah?  It's in that box."  She pointed to a copper box that was inlaid with stainless steel wire.  The man went to the box, opened it, and pulled out a necklace flute like the one the cop had played.  He came over to me, knelt, and held the necklace up as if I were winning a medal.  I leaned forward and let him put it around my neck.

The man got up and walked away, and I looked at the flute that now hung from my neck.  Like the box it came out of, it was made of copper with stainless steel accents.  Unlike everything else in the room, the flute was shiny.  It had a look of gratuitous precision, and it had clearly been made in a machine shop.  If I had a very small screwdriver, I could disassemble the flute into about twenty pieces and put it back together.  On its top side, there were three finger holes and a ring that stuck up like a fin.  The necklace was a fine chain of stainless steel.

The other men in the room pulled flutes out from under their shirts.  Their flutes had the same basic design as mine, with three finger holes and a ring, but they looked like they were made in a blacksmith shop or maybe even in a cave like this one.  They were all made of weathered copper, and one of them had a leather necklace.  The other two had ordinary necklaces like you'd get from a department store.

Angeline said, "Every Kayhotul man has a ketnah.  When a man dies, his ketnah waits in this room, until one day it goes to a boy.  It stays with the boy until he grows and dies, and then it waits for another boy.  If a boy has no ketnah waiting for him, the men of his family will make one for him.

"Arch, your grandfather, was a takmoten, a Kayhotul who was born a Pukruh.  He was the only takmoten of his century, because only a Pukruh who is truly dedicated to our survival may become one of us.  Your father, though he married a Kayhotul, does not know the Kayhotul, and he remains a Pukruh.

"Arch had no Kayhotul ancestors, so no ketnah waited for him.  He had no Kayhotul relatives, except by marriage.  Maguerite's family, his Kayhotul family by marriage, offered to make him a ketnah, but he chose to make his own.  He said he had to make it himself so it would truly be his."  She grinned.  "As you can see, he made it his own way."  Everyone chuckled.

"You are Arch's only grandson.  You are the only Kayhotul in all the world who is related to him.  His ketnah is now your ketnah, and you will carry it until you die."  She pointed at the box where the ketnah had come from.  "Remember that box.  Arch made the box as he made your ketnah.  Someday your ketna will wait in the box again.  And when your grandson's grandson's grandson dies, it will wait there again.  The ketna and the box will carry your mark forever."

She was quiet for a moment while I studied the box.  Then she said, "Go ahead, try playing it."

Frances said, "Your pinky goes in the ring."

I played a few notes.  Now I understood what the ring was for.  When the ketnah was supported by my lips and my pinky finger, I could take all my other fingers off the holes and still play it.

I played a few more notes, trying to make them sound like one of my grandmother's songs.  It was pretty easy to find the right notes, since the ketnah was tuned to the right scale and there weren't many notes to choose from.  Everybody was thrilled.  Angeline picked up the tune on her instrument, which she left in her lap and played like a dulcimer, with the strings facing upward.  The men joined in with their ketnahs.  I couldn't exactly remember how the tune went, so I played quietly and faked it.  All the women sang in the language of my grandmother, the language that was familiar yet alien.

Then there was a really startling sound.  The other old woman had hit the chime, and the whole room reverberated.  I felt like I was sitting inside an instrument.  The chime must have been tuned to this cave, and its permanent location must have been chosen for the effect.  No one else was surprised -- they just kept playing.  She hit the chime several more times before the song finished, and I learned to expect it and not jump.

During the song, the male cop, another man, and a woman came in.  The woman carried a guitar case in one hand and an instrument like Angeline's in the other.  The cop carried two Thermoses, and the other guy had several empty mugs and a sleeping pad.  They all sang along as they entered.

When the song ended, the newcomers settled in behind me.  Frances got up and took the guitar case, and then I remembered that I had seen the woman's picture in the motel.  She was Frances's mother.  This was a weird way to meet my girlfriend's parents.

Angeline greeted them and said, "Ian knows the Tnaha'lapec!"

Frances's mother said, "Oh, that's great!"

I turned around to see them, and Frances's father offered his hand.  "Dave Wentworth," he said.  I shook his hand, and he nearly crushed mine.  He said, "Last time I saw you, you could only shake my finger."

Mrs. Wentworth said, "I'm Gladys.  Boy, you've sure grown!"

Their comments reminded me that they were not only my girlfriend's parents, but also my relatives.  I had no idea what to say to them.

Frances, who had gone away from the group to unpack her guitar, came back and sat down.  I suddenly felt weird sitting next to her.  I didn't know what to think of her.

Angeline asked, "Do you know the story of that song?"

I shook my head.  "No, I don't know what any of the songs mean.  She didn't translate them."

"The Tnaha'lapec is about the bats.  It's a children's song."[Did we know he knew more than one song?]

"Oh," I said.

Mr. Wentworth said, "Anybody want some coffee?  There's plenty o' mugs."

I was far too nervous to drink coffee, and I certainly wasn't having any trouble staying awake.  A couple other people accepted the offer, and they passed the coffee around as Angeline continued.

"We'll tell you the story sometime, but tonight we have other stories to tell.  We must sing you the songs that tell where we came from and tell you what they mean.  Someday you will know the songs and sing them to your children."

All this talk about my progeny made me a little uncomfortable, because I had no plans in that direction.  They seemed awfully confident about it.

Angeline looked at the group and said, "Let's sing the Neptah Setokah."  With that, everyone became more somber.  They put their mugs down and picked up their instruments.

The chime rang again.  This time, it was the only sound.  It was like the sound of my own head vibrating.  Then, as the chime grew quiet, I could hear its echoes returning from distant parts of the cave.  The echoes reminded me that while we sat here with our music and our oil lamps and our hot coffee, we were surrounded by spaces in the Earth that were, at that same moment, empty and completely lightless.  I couldn't help thinking of what it would be like to be in one of those black spaces, cut off from humanity, like a cooling ember taken out of a fire.

The chime rang twice more, and then the other instruments joined in with a slow, eerie tune.  The music reinforced the cold and isolation of the cave.  It reminded me of the fact that I was undergound with strangers who knew secrets about me.

Some of the men sang instead of playing their ketnahs, adding some low voices to the song.  I had never heard the song, so I just listened, surrounded by it.

This song was much longer than the first one.  The mood of the song changed periodically, sometimes warm and sometimes excited.  Mostly, though, it seemed to describe a long and difficult life.

After a long time, the song ended with one final ring of the chime.  Everyone sat and listened while the sound of the chime explored the cave again.

When it was quiet, Angeline said, "The Neptah Setokah is the story of where we came from.  I'll tell you what the song says.  We won't be playing for a while, so you can all get comfortable."

The coffee and mugs started going around again.  Frances's mother passed her a blanket, which Frances spread over both of us.  She leaned against me, and I was glad for the warmth, but I wasn't sure if it was appropriate.

Then Angeline, who needed no coffee or blanket, told the story of the Neptah Setokah.
