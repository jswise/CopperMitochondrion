# Chapter 16

I drove into town and went to my office to think.  I wanted to talk to Zeke, but of course there was no chance of finding him.  I wanted to talk to Frances, but I wasn't sure how to find her, either.  We hadn't talked about getting in touch during the break.

I knew her last name, since it was part of her email address, so I tried looking up her parents' phone number online.  Predictably, her name turned out to be rather common in Grosvenor, and I had no way of knowing which listing was for her parents.  For all I knew, perhaps none of them were her parents.  I considered calling all of them.  In a town where everyone probably knew each other, I could probably just call anybody, regardless of their last name, and ask them where to find Frances.  But if the town was small enough for that to work, then it was small enough that everyone would know some weird guy from Frances's college was randomly calling people.  I decided it was better not to call anybody.

I tried Googling her.  I found out that she had a website, which was mainly about chemical engineering and her favorite bands.  I learned that she was part of an online community that discussed geothermal energy and another that discussed quilting.  I didn't learn her parents' phone number.

I thought about emailing her, but I didn't know if she would check her email during the break.  I didn't even know what I would write.  Hey Frances, what's up with our genes?  I could ask her if she really gave my cheek cells to Colleen, but questioning her integrity was probably best done in person, not by email.

Maybe all this could just wait until Frances came back to school.  Maybe it could even wait until Zeke came back in the spring.  I wasn't even sure what I wanted to know.  But I definitely wanted to know something.

I decided to go to Grosvenor.  I didn't know what I'd do when I got there, but I needed to go.  I printed out a map, since I wasn't sure I'd remember the route, and I hit the road.

In Maine in December, it gets dark at about 4:00 or 4:30.  The sun was setting when I left my office, and it was quite dark by the time I turned off Route 1 and headed down toward Grosvenor.

Black railroad cars loomed beside the road, and the power plant, covered with orangish lights, rose beyond them.  I passed the cement plant and then the quarry, which was lit with white floodlights.  I briefly wondered if I could get in and see if there was any copper ore.  But that was just the geologist in me, and that wasn't what I was here for.  I was here to find out what I was.

The road turned dark as I drove beyond the quarry and down past the Wolmaquill Falls picnic area.  Then I came into town and saw the gas statlion and the abandoned motel.

I slowed down and stared at the motel as I went by.  It was the only thing in Grosvenor that I had any connection to, with the possible exception of Frances.  However, I didn't really know anything about it.  Did my great aunt own it?  Did some cousin of mine still own it?  Why was it abandoned?

I continued down the road, studying the dark harbor and random buildings.  I saw the grocery store where Eleanore and I had parked, and I knew I was almost out of the town.  I turned around, drove back to the harbor, and parked on the street.

In any normal town, people would be out Christmas shopping.  However, everything was closed except the grocery store and the gas station, and even in the daytime you'd be hard pressed to find a Christmas present in Grosvenor.  They must have gone somewhere else to do their Christmas shopping, or maybe they bought each other groceries and beer.  In any case, nobody was walking around.

I got out of the car and walked up the street, toward the motel.  In the houses, I could see the flickering, blue glow of televisions.

Many of the houses had Chrismas lights, and a few had really tacky displays in their front yards.  One house had a giant, inflatable snow globe out front.  A blower hummed softly in the snow globe as bits of Styrofoam cascaded gently down the inside of the plastic.  Another house had two Santas, one plastic and one nylon, or whatever those inflatable figures are made of.  I wondered what the implications of having two Santas in one place might be.  Is Santa Claus a time traveler?  Is that how he delivers all those toys in one night?  Does he occasionally run into himself while he's scurrying around on Christmas Eve?  Or are there two Santas who now must have a duel to the death?

I could see the motel ahead.  This time, I was walking up the same side of the street that the motel was on.  I mainly recognized it by the fact that it was totally dark.  Farther up the street, I could see more Christmas lights and the intense lights of the gas station.

I really wanted to know what was in that motel.  The upstairs part, the part that wasn't boarded up, might be the home where my relatives once lived.  I didn't know what I expected to find -- it's not like there'd be a family tree pinned to the wall -- but maybe there'd be pictures or something.  Maybe it would just be an empty space, but at least I could stand in that space and know that it was in some way mine.  There was a reasonable likelihood that I had been there as a baby, back when I was a part of this community, back when everybody knew what was going on.  I was too young to know who I was or where I was or that my mitochondrial DNA was different from my father's.  But that was coming;  I was supposed to learn.  It's too bad everybody died before they could tell me.

When I got close to the motel, I could see that the parking lot was full of snow.  It hadn't been plowed, and there were no footprints.  The car I had seen there at Thanksgiving was still in the same place, but now it was covered with a foot and a half of undisturbed snow.  It was clear that no one lived there, so I started looking for a way in.

Just past the motel, there was a plowed driveway for the house next door.  The driveway ran close to the end of the motel and led to a detached garage that was sort of behind the house.  Whoever plowed the driveway had pushed the snow into a high bank along the side nearest the motel.

My heart started pounding as if I were about to give a speech.  I tried to look normal and inconspicuous, not looking around too much.  Looking around makes people look suspicious.

I walked up the driveway, where I wouldn't leave any tracks.  I watched the house nervously.  There were two windows on this end, but they were both dark.  Looking into the house, I could see light coming from more distant rooms.  Hopefully nobody was sitting in the dark and watching me.

At the far end of the driveway, which was near the back corner of the motel, I clambored over the snowbank.  The snow was packed and lumpy, and I didn't think my tracks would be too noticeable.  On the other side, I plopped into two feet of powder and quickly went around the back of the motel.

Snow fell into my shoes, freezing my ankles.  Each time I lifted a foot, I packed more snow in there.  I should have worn different clothes for this.

The windows back here were covered with plywood, just like the windows in front.  I had hoped to find some way to get on the roof, so I could get to one of the second floor windows.  I thought there might be an electric meter with a conduit that I could climb, or an outdoor oil tank, or even a strong downspout, but all I saw were boarded-up windows and an overhanging roof.

I walked along the back of the motel, hoping for inspiration.  When I was at the two-story part of the building, under the tantalizingly uncovered windows, I tripped.  I was moving slowly and kind of crouching, so I sort of gently stumbled and didn't hit the ground very hard.  Actually, what I hit wasn't the ground, but a sloping, snow-covered surface that made a sound like a muffled bass drum.  I froze and studied the shape of the snowy lump that I had landed on.  Then I realized it was a bulkhead door, the kind of door that leads to a basement.

I scooted around to the low end of the door, the end farthest from the building.  I was wearing mittens, so I dug in the snow until I found the handle.  It turned.  The bulkhead wasn't locked.

I didn't know if getting into the basement would get me any closer to the second floor, but I was thrilled.  I'd much rather be in a basement, where no one can see me, than tromping around in the open with snow in my shoes.   I pushed most of the snow off the door, since I didn't think I could lift the door with all that snow on it, but I left a little bit so it would still be white.  Then I opened the door partway, careful not to dump the rest of the snow off, and slipped in.

I crouched on the steps in the bulkhead and closed the door over my head, and then I could see nothing.  I took my mittens off and pulled out my keychain, which had a small flashlight on it.  I put my fingers over the lens, turned the light on, and then allowed a tiny bit of light out through a crack between my glowing fingers.

I half expected to find a locked door inside the bulkhead, but I was lucky.  The steps led right into the basement.  I turned my light off, since I now knew where the steps and the floor were, and I waddled downward, gradually standing up as my headroom increased.

When I got to the floor, I saw a green LED hovering in the black void.  I froze.  Was it a security system?  Why was there electricity in an abandoned building, anyway?  I stood still for a while, and nothing happened.  No alarms went off, and the light didn't turn red or anything.  As my eyes adjusted, I could see the general layout of the basement by the faint, green light coming from the LED, but I still couldn't tell what the LED was for.  I carefully turned my flashlight back on and shined a crack of light at the LED.  It was part of a boiler.

The boiler was much larger than the one at Puppet House.  Beyond it, I saw a tank that was about ten feet long, presumably the oil tank.  I walked closer to the LED so I could read the text next to it, to verify that the boiler really was on.  It was.

I turned the flashlight back off and pondered this.  Why was the boiler on in an abandoned building?  Maybe it was to keep the pipes from freezing.  This basement wasn't much warmer than the air outside, so the boiler must not be very active.  Maybe the thermostats upstairs were at their lowest settings.

A noise startled me.  Some kind of fan had started running.  I shined my flashlight where the noise was coming from, and I saw a small, electric heater sitting on a workbench.  I gathered that there weren't any thermostats in the basement, so this was how they kept the basement from freezing.  The heater must have an extra-low setting, I thought, if it waits until it's this cold before coming on.  Maybe it was a special Maine basement heater.

I was getting a little bolder with the flashlight.  I looked around and found a battered set of stairs.  I went to the bottom of the stairs and saw a closed door at the top.  I stepped slowly and gently up the stairs, though it was impossible to avoid a few squeaks and groans from the steps.

I tried the door.  The knob didn't turn.  This one was locked.  There was no deadbolt, though, so there was still hope.  I just needed something thin and strong and something for prying.

I quietly went down to the workbench and found a hacksaw blade and a very small crowbar of the sort you'd use for removing molding.  I put my mittens back on before picking them up, because I was afraid of leaving fingerprints.  Then I went quietly back up the stairs, set the hacksaw blade on the top step, held the flashlight in my mouth, and went to work with the little crowbar.

The door was meant to open away from me.  That meant that on my side of the door, there was a thin strip of molding on the doorway.  If the doorknob was normal, the bolt would be sloped, with the slope facing toward me.  My goal was to push on the sloped part of the bolt with the hacksaw blade and make it retract.

Breathing quietly with a flashlight in your mouth isn't easy.  Using a small tool while wearing mittens isn't easy, either.  I wanted to avoid making any marks on the molding, but I accidentally made a couple indentations and scraped some paint off.

I managed to separate the molding from the doorway just a little bit, creating a small crack between them.  I slid the hacksaw blade into the crack, found the bolt, and shoved on it.  The blade met resistance but went through.  I took the flashlight out of my mouth and held it in my mitten to block the light.  Then I pushed on the door, and it opened.

I sat motionless for a while, to see if anything would happen.  With all the plywood on the windows, it was totally dark and quiet.  I heard a click behind me, my heart pounded, and I jumped as the boiler came to life.  Then I laughed a little, freed my flashlight, and took the tools back down to the workbench.  The boiler was pretty loud, which made me feel a lot better about walking down the stairs.

I tried to put the tools back exactly where I had found them.  I didn't want anyone to know I had been there.

I decided to leave my mittens on this time.  I couldn't turn the flashlight off very easily with them on, but I could cover the lens if I needed to.  I shined the light at the stairs, covered it, and walked up the stairs in darkness.

At the top of the stairs, I felt for the doorway with a mittened hand.  I pushed the molding back into place, hoping no one would notice it.  Then I pushed the door the rest of the way open and stepped out into the darkness.  I stood motionless again, just to make sure nothing was happening up here.  I coud faintly hear cars driving by.

I let a little bit of light escape from my mitten.  I was in a small, cluttered office.  I wanted to find another set of stairs, and they'd probably be directly above the basement stairs.  To my right, in the same wall as the door to the basement stairs, was an open doorway.

I turned the knob on the office side of the basement door, just to make sure I wasn't going to get locked in here.  I gently moved the door until it was almost closed but didn't latch it.  I wanted to be able to open it again without making any noise.

When I left the office, I found myself behind the motel's front desk.  I had never been on this side of a motel desk before, and I was surprised at how much clutter it concealed.

That was when it struck me that this motel wasn't abandoned.  It really was just closed for the season, like the sign said.  There were tools in the basement, there was clutter in the office, and there was clutter at the front desk.  I looked at the computer on the front desk and saw that it was fairly new.  For a moment, I was afraid there might be people here.  But then I remembered the parking lot full of snow and the lack of footprints outside.  No one could be in here unless they never left the building.

The front desk ran parallel to the stairs I had come up.  At the other end of the desk was a doorway to the right.  The doorway was obscured from guests by a partition next to the desk.  I went to the doorway, and I found that it led to a short hallway.  At the other end of the hallway was a boarded-up door that I assumed went outside.  There were a couple other doors, and immediately to my right was what I wanted.  It was a stairway leading up.

This stairway was carpeted and much quieter than the basement stairs.  I climbed the stairs and tried the door at the top.  This one was unlocked.

I clumsily turned my flashlight off with my mittened hands.  The second floor didn't have plywood over the windows, and I didn't want anyone to see the light from outside.  Then I slowly opened the door.

I was in a kitchen.  On the opposite side of the room was a window that faced downtown Grosvenor.  This must have been the end of the building.  Faint light came in from distant streetlights.

The stove and the microwave each had a glowing green clock display.  The one on the microwave flashed 12:00.  When I looked at the display on the stove, I was surprised at how late it was.  Then I realized it was still on daylight savings time.

The counters were all clean, but I noticed something on the floor in front of the sink.  I walked over to it and bent down to look more closely at it.  What I saw was so unexpected that it took me a while, in the shadows of the kitchen floor, to figure out what it was.

The cupboard doors were open.  A toilet valve, which is to say a little tower like the one inside your toilet tank, was lashed with wire to the support between the open doors.  A small hose connected it to the plumbing under the sink.  I couldn't see inside the cupboard very well, but I gathered that someone had disconnected the cold water from the sink in order to hook this thing up.  Like many toilet valves, this one had a metal arm with a large float on the end.  Unlike most floats, this one floated in a big soup pot instead of a toilet tank.  A small C-clamp was clamped to the rim of the pot, and a piece of silicone tubing lead from the valve to the C-clamp.  The tubing was threaded through the clamp so it would point downard, and a bit of duct tape kept it from shooting out.

It was a very clever way to do something, but I wasn't sure what.  Or rather, I knew what it did -- clearly, it kept the soup pot full of water -- but I didn't know why.  I had never winterized a building, but it didn't seem like there was any benefit to keeping a soup pot full of water on the kitchen floor.  Was someone concerned about dry air, perhaps?

Unfortunately, the next thing I saw explained it.  Near the pot, I saw a pile of bones.  I don't mean bones like the skeleton of something that had died here, which actually would have been less alarming.  I mean bones like you get from a butcher shop to give to a dog, or if you're from Grosvenor, to feed to a dog.

I jerked my head up and looked around the kitchen.  If there was a dog here, I was in about the most incriminating position possible, from a dog's perspective.  I stood up and stepped away from the bones.

I was tempted to bolt out of the building, but I stood still and thought about it.  Would anyone really leave a dog locked in a house alone all winter with nothing but a pile of bones and some water?  It was a horrible thought.  But aside from being cruel, it wouldn't be in the owner's interest.  They'd come back in the spring to find that the dog had gone insane and ripped the house to shreds.  There'd be shit, piss, and pillow stuffing everywhere, and a frenzied dog to boot.  And even if Grosvenor dogs could live on bones, which still seemed doubtful, there weren't enough bones here to last through the winter.

On the other hand, if the dog was insane, it didn't improve my position at all.  Was I alone with a starving dog?  Would the owners come back in the spring to find my bones on the kitchen floor, or perhaps hidden here and there under couch cushions and beds?

I tried to bring myself back to reality.  I hadn't actually seen a dog.  If there was a dog, it surely would have noticed me by now.  I decided that the pot and bones must have had some purpose while the people were still here.  Maybe these things kept the dog occupied while the people were busy boarding the place up and changing the sign.  Maybe the people went away for a few days and came back before leaving for the winter.  Regardless of whether or not I could discern the purpose of the water and bones, it was just too unlikely that a dog would be here alone.

Slightly relieved but still nervous, I walked into the next room.  It was the living room.  It smelled faintly of mothballs, and an afghan was draped over the back of the couch.  It seemed like a place where old people lived.

There were a lot of different kinds of knickknacks in the room, but what immediately caught my attention was an end table with a bunch of framed photographs standing on it.  I didn't know what I was looking for, but this seemed like as good an objective as any.  I went to the table, took my mittens off, and carefully turned my flashlight on with my fingers over the lens.

What I found there freaked me out.  I really don't know if I was surprised or if I expected to find it, but at some level, this was the reason I went into the motel in the first place.  Standing among the photos on the end table was a slightly different version of the picture my father had sent me.  It was a picture of me.

I could imagine my grandmother and great aunt standing there, holding us babies, facing toward the same street I just walked up, while someone took pictures of them with two different cameras.  Maybe it was my great uncle who took the pictures, though I had no idea if he was alive at the time.  Maybe he was just about to drive us to the airport in Bangor or Portland, and they wanted to be sure to get a picture while we were all together.  And a few minutes before that, we were probably all in this room.  I probably played on this floor with the other baby, my second cousin.  We probably all had breakfast in that kitchen, perhaps with a big, white dog munching bones at our feet.

I looked at the other photographs.  They all looked like normal family pictures, except that everyone was either pale or sunburned, all the adults were bald, and most of the people ranged from chubby to obese.  Then, with a start, I realized that I was looking at a picture of Frances.  It must have been from her high school graduation, because she was wearing a cap and gown.  She had her arms around two older women, one of whom was clearly my great aunt.  Great Aunt Margaret looked disturbingly similar in this picture to the way she looked in the other picture.  She was one of those people who look indeterminately old, who look the same when they're ninety as they did when they were seventy.  The other woman in the picture was probably in her fifties, and she looked a little like Frances and a little like Great Aunt Margaret.

I stood up and turned the flashlight off.  Was Frances my second cousin, the baby in the picture?  That was a gross thought.  I shuddered.  I didn't look at any more pictures, because I was afraid I would see the transformation between the baby in front of the motel and the woman I had recently had sex with.

I decided to see what was in the other rooms.  With the flashlight off, I went slowly down a hallway.

I saw a black area on the wall; it was an open doorway leading to a totally dark room.  I put my fingers over the flashlight, turned it on, and shined a little light into the room.  It was a windowless bathroom with newspaper on the floor.  Several piles of old, dried-up dogshit sat on the newspaper.  They must have trained the dog to shit in here while they were out.  Apparently, they were in so much of a hurry to get away for the winter that they didn't stop to clean it up.  Maybe they thought it would be less disgusting when it was old.  I turned the light off and continued down the hall.

The next room was also dark.  I shined a little light in there, and the first thing I noticed was that heavy curtains covered the windows.  The second thing I noticed was a low growl.

I jerked my head and my light toward the growl, and then I was petrified.  A big, white dog was curled up on the bed.  The dog was half asleep and had barely raised its head to growl at me.  The dog was confident, and there was no need for it to get out of bed.  We both knew I'd be dead if I came any closer.

The dog was flanked by two big lumps in the covers.  My first, horrified thought was that the lumps were corpses that had been lying in the bed for months.  Then one of them stirred, and an elderly woman looked at me.

I was backing carefully toward the door, trying not to excite the dog.  I wanted to let the dog know that everything was cool.  But the woman gaped at me and started... well, making a sound.

I don't know a word for the sound that she made.  It was inaudible at first, but it slowly developed into an eerie moan.  She inhaled sharply and then built her moan into a shriek.

The other lump moved, and I saw an old man peer over the dog.  Then he lunged to the other side of the bed, and through the shriek I heard the sound of a drawer opening.

I didn't wait to find out what was in the drawer.  I was in the doorway, so I sidestepped out of sight and then ran.  I uncovered my flashlight, since this obviously wasn't a time for stealth.  I ran through the hallway, the living room, and the kitchen.  I hadn't run through a house since I was little, and it's a  lot harder to make the corners when you're an adult.  I bumped into doorways and walls but managed to stay upright.  On the way out, I noticed something odd on the wall by the door, but I didn't have time to look at it or even think about it.

I slammed the door behid me, and I immediately felt better.  Now the dog wouldn't be able to follow me unless the people opened the door, and they couldn't get there nearly as fast as the dog could.  But the dog must not have been following, or I'd be dying on the living room floor right now.

With the flashlight in one hand and the railing in the other, I thunked down the steps two at a time.  I thought about going out the back door, but I didn't know if I could open it, and I didn't want to waste any time trying.  I headed for the basement.

As I ran behind the front desk and through the office, I thought about the thing I had seen on the kitchen wall.  It was a small circuit board with stuff soldered to it, obviously a homemade circuit.  It was on the end of a cable that came through a small hole in the wall.  It was, I realized, a homemade thermostat.  A circle of turquoise paint on the wall marked the place where a regular thermostat had once been.

I went to the basement stairs, this time shutting the door quickly but quietly.  I didn't want them to know where I was.  I leapt down the stairs and into the bulkhead.

I wanted to open the bulkhead door a little, peek out, and see if anyone had gone out the back door already.  But the bulkhead door opened the wrong way, so I couldn't see in that direction.  I flung the door open, jumped out, and didn't see anybody.  I shut the door -- I'm not sure why -- and I ran, stumbling in the deep snow, to the end of the building.

I scrambled over the snowbank and ran down the driveway.  I ran right out into the street, which was empty.  I suddenly felt conspicuous running across the street, so I slowed to a trot, imagining that I was just in a hurry to cross the street before a car came.  When I got to the far curb, I walked at something like a normal speed.  I turned and walked up the sidewalk, away from the motel and, unfortunately, away from my car.

At the first chance I got, I turned down a side street, hoping I could double back somehow.  If this were Arizona, I could just walk around the block or walk down a parallel street until I was even with my car.  In New England, however, streets rarely run in a grid pattern like they do out west.  If you try to go around the block, you might end up going right out of town, or you might cross a bridge or a railroad track and find out why Mainers famously say "Ya can't get theyuh from heyuh."

There wasn't exactly a block to go around, but it wasn't too bad.  I went on a little tour of a funky neighborhood of split-level houses from the 1960s, with wavy streets and several cul-de-sacs.  I stuck to the street that I was on, which eventually led me back to the main road.

I tried to act nonchalant as I walked back to my car, very conscious of the fact that I was the only person walking through Grosvenor in the middle of the night.  At one point, headlights approached from behind me, which freaked me out, but it turned out to be just an 18-wheeler on its way to the grocery store.  I saw my car and couldn't wait to get inside and become anonymous.

Unfortunately, things definitely did not improve when I got in the car.  Just as I was putting the key in the ignition, a voice came out of nowhere.  It was a man's voice, clear and close.  The voice said slowly, "Find what you wuh lookin' fowah?"

I was so startled that I dropped my keys and lurched away from the sound.  I'm surprised I didn't shit my pants or hurt myself somehow.

With my shoulder touching my window, I looked to my right and saw a cop sitting in the front passenger seat.  He was pale and bald.  He looked quite calm, and he was holding a small object in his right hand.  I assumed it was a can of pepper spray.

From a purely academic perspective, I wondered what would happen if he used pepper spray inside a car.  We'd probably both be incapacitated, but I'd be a lot more incapacitated than he would.  It didn't matter, of course, because I had no intention of doing anything but being petrified.

The cop said, "I'll take those keys."

My keys were somewhere in the darkness near my feet.  I leaned over toward the cop, getting uncomfortably close to his can of pepper spray, put my head beside the steering wheel, and felt the floor.  I found the keys, came up, and handed them to the cop.

The cop dropped the keys into a shirt pocket, then touched a microphone on his shoulder and said, "He's heeyuh."

A few seconds later, lights flashed somewhere behind me.  A cop car zoomed down the road and pulled up behind my car.  I got that sick feeling you get when you're at the center of all those lights, your car filled with white light and everything around you flashing blue.  I noticed -- I don't know what makes me think of these things -- that unlike cop cars in Arizona, this one had only blue lights and not red.

With his left hand, the cop reached for his door latch.  He said, "Step outta the cah, please."

I got out.  The cop got out and came around the front of the car, and the other cop got out of her car and approached me.  She told me to put my hands on the roof of the car.  She had a noticeable Maine accent, but it wasn't as strong as the guy's.  I put my hands on the roof, and the male cop frisked me.  It was the first time I'd ever been frisked.

When he was finished frisking me, the female cop said, "Lift one of your feet."  I had never seen this in movies, so I wasn't really sure what she wanted.  I lifted my right foot off the ground, and she grabbed my ankle and pulled my foot up toward my butt.  I thought she was doing this to immobilize me, but then I realized she was shining a flashlight on the sole of my shoe.  She must have seen my footprints in the snow.

She put my foot down, took my arm, and said, "Step this way, please."  She led me to the cop car while the guy followed.  Then -- another first -- they put me in the cop car.

The two cops stood behind the cop car, apparently having a conference.  At first I thought they were calling the dispatcher on the radio, but then it occurred to me that the radio in the car was silent.  Maybe they were discussing whether or not they had probable cause.  Do cops discuss constitutional law when they're out on patrol?  Maybe they were just talking about their union or their kids or something, and they weren't in a hurry to go and book me.

I thought about what I would say.  How much did they know?  Had I left any fingerprints?  What would happen if I told the truth?  Should I say I just happened to be walking around Grosvenor in the middle of the night, and it was a coincidence that the footprints behind the motel happened to match my shoes?  I couldn't think of anything that would help, so I decided it would be best if I didn't say anything at all.

When I considered the option of being silent, I realized that they hadn't read me my rights.  They hadn't said what I was charged with, either.  I wasn't sure they had even arrested me at all.  And come to think of it, weren't they supposed to handcuff me before putting me in the back of the car?  Wasn't that just standard procedure?

The cops got into the car.  The woman, who was in the driver's seat, touched a computer screen, and the lights stopped flashing.  She looked at me in the mirror and said, quite unexpectedly, "Are you Marguerite DuFresne's grandson?"

Like Zeke, she had called my grandmother by her maiden name.  Even though I had planned on being silent, this was too much of a nonsequitor to ignore.  "Yes," I said.

She nodded, and I couldn't see her expression.  The guy looked at her and grinned.  She tilted in the seat and pulled out a cellphone and called someone.

When she talked on the phone, it was in a foreign language.  I thought maybe people spoke a lot of French around here, like in Quebec.  But you know how when people speak a foreign language, you can kind of tell what language it is, even if you can't understand what they're saying?  By the time she had spoken a couple sentences, it was clear that she wasn't speaking French.  I had no idea what language it was, but it was as different from French as Navajo is from Spanish.  It didn't even sound European.  There was something faintly familiar about it, like it resembled something I'd heard before, but I couldn't think of any country where they talked like that.

The cop hung up and said one word to the other cop.  The word seemed to be in the same language she'd been speaking on the phone.  She put the phone away, called the dispatcher on the radio, and said something in copspeak.  Then she buckled her seatbelt and put the car into gear.

The cop in the passenger seat did something very uncoplike.  He turned in his seat, smiled, and said, "Congratulations!"  He said it warmly, like I had just had a baby, not boisterously, like if I had won a wrestling match.  He really meant it.  Sitting in the back of a cop car, about to be booked, I could see no reason for congratulations.  I assumed he was demented.

As the car started moving, he faced forward and put his seatbelt on.  Then he reached into his collar with the tips of his fingers and drew out a necklace.  He fished out the thing that was hanging from the necklace and held it up to his mouth.  I heard a whistling sound, and in the shifting light I saw that he was playing a small, copper flute with just his right hand.  He played a slow tune that sounded mournful, to the extent that a tune can sound mournful when played on a high-pitched instrument.

We drove into a residential neighborhood that was behind the grocery store.  Instead of going to a police station, we stopped in front of a house.

I was hoping the cops might say or do something to indicate what in God's name we were doing here, but the man just kept playing his flute, and the woman got stranger.  She touched her computer screen and turned on the light bar, illuminating the whole block in flashing blue.  She touched the screen a few more times, then held a microphone up to her partner's flute.  The harsh, mournful tune went out over the car's PA system and echoed off the houses.

I leaned over to my right so I could look up at the house.  The lights were on upstairs, and every once in a while I saw movement in one of the windows.

This is a totally different subject, but an odd thing about Mainers is that they have an aversion to using the front door of a house.  I think it's because they always have snow or mud on their shoes and don't want to track it through the living room.  A typical Maine house has a showy central door plus another door that leads to a mudroom or the kitchen.  Just inside the second door, you'll find a bunch of wet boots on the floor and parkas on hooks, and you're supposed to add your boots and parka to the pile.  If, due to some oversight, a house doesn't have the second door, they'll leave the garage door open so you can go in that way and leave your boots in the kitchen.  The showy front door is so neglected that people don't even shovel a path through the snow to it, and sometimes you'll see potted plants blocking the door.  Puppet House was an exception to all this, because it just had one door and no garage.  The combination porch and puppet workshop wasn't a safe place to leave anything, and the living room floor was covered with plastic anyway.

But I digress.  To continue, I was held captive by two insane cops while they serenaded a whole neighborhood in the middle of the night.  I won't even bother trying to explain why this was happening.

One of the lights went off upstairs, and then lights came on downstairs.  Someone went into the mudroom to put on a parka.  Then an outside light came on, competing with the blue cop lights.

Finally, the person came out the door.  It was a small person in a big, yellow parka and an Elmer Fudd hat.  The parka seemed to lose its color as the person moved away from the house and toward the flashing, blue lights.  Then, to my astonishment, I saw that the person wearing it was Frances.

Frances didn't ask what was going on.  She just walked up to the car and got in.  She smiled at me and said hi, evidently not at all surprised to find me in the back of a cop car in Grosvenor.  She was beaming, as if I had arranged a special date.  To the driver, she said, "My parents'll meet us there."

I didn't know if I should be happy or terrified.  It was nice to see her, but her presence was further evidence that the situation was getting more bizarre by the minute.  The fact that she acted totally normal just made things worse.

As the driver put the microphone away and put the car in gear, Frances looked at me and giggled.  "You're looking at me like I have three heads," she said.

I tried to smile.  "I'm a little freaked out.  What's going on?"

She scooted closer and took my hand.  "It's your..."  And then she said a word that I can only transcribe as "tnaklatuh."  It was the same word that one cop had said to the other, the word that had made him start playing his flute.  It really didn't explain anything.

I asked, "Is that why he's playing that song?"

She smiled encouragingly.  "Yeah," she said, "that's the tnaklatuh song.  It means someone's coming of age.  You're going to be part of the community."

"Is this like hazing?"

She laughed.  "No, we'll be nice to you.  Think of it as a barmitzvah."

I thought about this for a few seconds, trying to figure out what it actually meant.  Trying to adopt a tactful tone of voice, I asked, "Are you in a cult?"

She laughed harder and squeezed my hand.  "It's not like that.  We're not gonna make you give us all your possessions and shave your head[no hair]."  I noticed that she didn't say no.

The one cop continued playing, while the other drove us out of the residential area and back to the main street.  We turned at the grocery store and drove away from the harbor, toward the edge of town.

Frances said, "You know why your grampa wanted you to come to Mines?"

"How do you know about my grandfather?"

"It's a small town."

"Did you, um..." I hesitated, not sure if I really wanted to know the answer to my question.  Then I blurted, "Did you have a grandmother named Marguerite?"

She laughed again.  "Did I?  You mean do I?  Yeah!  You scared the shit out of her.  It's lucky you didn't give her a heart attack."

I pointed over my shoulder with my thumb.  "But that's... We're not related, right?"

She gave me a naughty grin.  "Your great aunt is my gramma.  We're sort of cousins.  It's kinda kinky, huh?"

This grossed me out.  I considered pulling my hand away from her grip.  But seeing her look at me like that, like we were conspiring to commit an act of sexual perversion, I nearly got an erection.  I had to admit that the physical attraction was still there.   I started to think that I was just as weird as everyone else in the car.
